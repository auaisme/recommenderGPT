    "title": "Undertale",
    "review": "I finished my first playthrough of Undertale in stunned silence. My journey had begun with dumb puns and silly puzzles, but the end affected me in a way I never expected. That’s kind of Undertale’s specialty — playing with our expectations of what an RPG should be, subverting them, and using them to drive a story unique to what games can do. Its strong writing, integration of gameplay with storytelling, and acute understanding of its audience all build to something that surprises at every turn.\nAs a lone human fallen into an underground world that serves as a prison for monsters, I had my journey laid out for me, as most RPG protagonists do. For my first playthrough I took a pacifist approach, being as kind and merciful as possible as I searched for a way back to the surface. But I made a mistake: I accidentally killed a monster in the beginning. So I restarted without saving, as I would in any other game when I needed a do-over. Except… things were different this time. Dialogue had changed to reflect that I’d seen her die. Then Flowey, Undertale’s chaotic evil, fourth wall-breaking flower, tore into me for having the gall to abuse the power of the save state.\nGaming the System\nUndertale expected me to have played RPGs before and played with those conventions in unexpected ways. That first berating from Flowey shaped the rest of my experience — I learned I couldn’t bank on a soft reset, so I had to tread carefully. Everything I did mattered. That clever manipulation of gameplay mechanics adds weight to a story that couldn’t have been told in any other way or medium. Undertale has to be a game, and that’s the key to its brilliance.\nIts dodging-based combat minigames especially rely on that concept. Boss battles consistently subverted my expectations, even after I thought I’d figured everything out, but even run-of-the-mill random encounters are closely intertwined with storytelling and worldbuilding. Every enemy has a unique personality expressed both through combat and non-combative options. In my pacifist run I ended up talking to a lot of monsters, giving out hugs, and even (and especially) flirting with them to avoid killing them. In order to spare a monster that wanted to flirt but didn’t want to admit it, I had to “get close but not too close.” That option changed the rules of combat so that I had to narrowly dodge incoming projectiles… until the monster blushed so much that it stopped fighting.\nUndertale has to be a game, and that’s the key to its brilliance.\n“\nThere are tons of jokes that appeal to internet nerds, and I often felt like Undertale was talking directly to me, like it knew what I was thinking. An anime-loving character’s “selfie,” for example, is actually a picture of a garbage can with pink sparkle filters over it (and speaking from experience, this is very accurate). I especially love Undertale’s humor when it has something to say, however subtle. I entered a snail race (called Thundersnail) and was told to press Z repeatedly to encourage my snail to win. I spammed Z until she burst into flames, and the Thundersnail organizer told me that “all that pressure to succeed really got to her.” It was, like many of Undertale’s one-off jokes, extremely relatable — and knowing and predicting its audience is one of Undertale’s biggest strengths.\nMonsters Are People Too\nUndertale’s writing is consistently funny, but it can also be touching. Small, semi-hidden notes and dialogue enrich the world and build on an already compelling story of humanity and morality. A favorite was a series of “echo flowers” in a beautiful, ethereal hallway that repeated snippets of an overhead conversation. A monster didn’t want to share her greatest wish — that one day she would climb the mountain that traps all the monsters underground and look out at the world — for fear of being laughed at, and although her friend promised they wouldn’t, the friend ended up laughing anyway. It was silly, until the last flower repeated: “Sorry, it’s just funny… That’s my wish too.”\nExperiencing the depth of the monsters’ hopes and dreams is crucial to Undertale’s exploration of morality, personhood, and conflict. Different monsters talk about each other in front of you, so once I met them I got to discover who they actually were, as opposed to what their reputations suggested. Most of the main characters are also very well developed with consistent personalities across different dialogue and story routes. It made it hard for me to summon the aggression to attack any of them — and that’s precisely the point. When I was trying to go for a more violent run, fighting monsters I’d once flirted with made Undertale’s message about humanity hit even harder.\nDetermination\nSome fights can be frustrating or even tedious, however, at least at first. In a violent playthrough, I had to grind quite a bit to meet certain story requirements and grew tired of it after a while. Fighting enemy after enemy replaced the puzzles in the peaceful runs, however, and the tradeoff felt very balanced and ultimately meaningful to the story. I also found myself trudging back through areas I had already cleared just so I could beat a boss or get an item, and while it was absolutely worth it in the end, I wasn't terribly excited to do it. At one point I had run out of gold and needed to buy healing items, and the only shop that would buy items off of me was about a 10 minute walk away. (The other shopkeepers don't buy items because they don't want your trash.)\nThat said, I don't regret any of the extra time I spent walking around, because I got to find things like Thundersnail and the echo flowers. It's the little details that make Undertale so special, and I wanted to see them all. Every one of them feels deliberate — long sections of dialogue at the beginning and certain fights can be slow, but they are necessary for establishing the characters in a way that only games can do. In a different run, underwhelming boss battles turn mournful because of what one-hit KOs imply in the world. It was Undertale's ongoing, well-woven theme of determination that kept me playing and replaying.\nEven though the art isn't always pretty — it's often ugly, even — Undertale is an incredibly expressive game from start to finish, making up for visual limitations with excellent music and charming animations. It's also gender- and sexuality-inclusive in a very real, noticeable way. Every small detail reveals an intimate understanding of its audience, and that is essential to what makes Undertale’s commentary on personhood so effective.\nPlaystation 4 Review, August 15 2017\nBy Brendan Graeber\n\nAfter playing through Undertale on PS4, I’m happy to report that everything was ported over to console perfectly (including the clever takes on saved games and more). The only real additions I spotted are on the periphery, like being able to set a background to the centered 4:3 ratio screen, and the dynamically changing art is a nice touch. You can also choose to navigate both the world and in combat using either analogue stick or D-pad. Both work well, but the sensitivity of the stick in certain fights had me preferring the buttons to the stick.\nVerdict\nIt's hard to express just how much I adore Undertale without spoiling anything significant, but that's what I love about it. It tells its story in such a dynamic way, and with such a great understanding of the RPG player’s mindset, that it couldn’t have been told in any other way. It's a masterfully crafted experience that I won't forget any time soon.",

    "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild",
    "review": "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s sheer freedom and sense of adventure is a remarkable achievement. Right from the start, the vast landscape of Hyrule is thrown completely open to you, and it constantly finds ways to pique your curiosity with mysterious landmarks, complex hidden puzzles, and enemy camps to raid for treasure and weapons. The fact that you can tackle any one of these things at your own pace and almost never get pulled to the main path is liberating, but the way all of Breath of the Wild’s systems fit elegantly into a complex light survival game is even more impressive. I’ve been running around for over 50 hours and I still have plenty of mysteries left to track down and lots of wonderfully crafted puzzles to solve. I’m in awe of the scope and scale of this adventure, and I often find myself counting the hours until I can get back in.\nThe untamed, post-apocalyptic, techno-fantasy land of Hyrule is the main character in Breath of the Wild. Not only is it vast, beautiful, and filled with a diverse set of locations from grassy fields to craggy alpine mountains, but it follows surprisingly realistic rules that let you pull off solutions so intuitive that you might be surprised they actually work. The trees bear fruit, grass fields can be set ablaze, and even enemies and animals behave in a believable manner, based on the skittish and aggressive reactions I’ve seen in the wild. But the realistic touches don’t end there. Each object you encounter, from sticks to apples to rocks and metallic blocks, is made of a material, and those materials usually respond to forces like fire and magnetism as you’d expect.\nZelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Graphical Comparison | Treehouse Live\n4:14\nAutoplay setting: On\nZelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Graphical Comparison | Treehouse Live\nIt all sets up a surprisingly fun and responsive sandbox to interact with, and one I’ve rarely seen executed so well in an action-adventure game. If you think something should work, it usually does, and that led me to all kinds of fun and hilarious experimentation. You can stand under an apple tree with a torch and bake the fruit into a quick-healing snack before you even pick it, or drop a metal sword in front of a weaponless enemy and watch it get fried by a bolt of lighting. Meanwhile, Link needs warmer clothes to survive the cold and flame-resistant gear to venture near the volcanic Death Mountain. It’s consistently amazing to learn how all of these systems interact with each other while you play.\nBut what elevates Breath of Wild above its open-world contemporaries is its sheer lack of restrictions, both in its non-linear questing structure and in your ability to climb almost any surface and travel in any direction once you leave the starting area. It is the heart of what makes this action-adventure truly special and addictive. Like many open-world games it delivers on the implied promise that if you can see it out in the distance, chances are you can eventually reach it – but here, figuring out how to get there is more often than not a satisfying puzzle in itself, and one that never gets old. For instance, a tantalizing island far off the coast of the mainland was just out of my paragliding reach for the first several hours until after I’d upgraded my abilities. When I finally did, what took place when I finally reached my objective was a great twist that blew my mind – including finding an easier alternate route I’d missed.\nWhat elevates Breath of Wild above its contemporaries is its sheer freedom.\n“\nThat paraglider is easily one of the most useful tools in Breath of the Wild because it's so versatile. You can use it to effortlessly glide across lakes and gaps or ride updrafts into new areas, and I often used each long trip across the map as a way to scan the marvelously lit horizon in search of clues or meditate on what I need to do next.\nEvery IGN Zelda Review Score\nVIEW 23 IMAGES\nFrom overhead you get a glimpse of what’s even more evident from the ground: each individual area has its own little ecology, and systems built around extreme hot and cold temperatures and high altitudes mean you have to take the time to think and prepare in order to travel safely through them. It doesn’t matter, for example, if you can glide into the chilly mountains if you’ll freeze to death before you hit the ground. Going in with the right equipment makes all the difference.\nThere are constant reminders that you are always at the mercy of the world itself.\n“\nAs you continue to improve Link’s stamina meter and skills you can reach even more of these varied locations. But no matter how much stronger you get, the world and its resident Mother Nature is always more powerful than you will ever be. Random events like rain and thunderstorms slow down your movement across slick surfaces, and dangerous lightning bolts can strike with little warning if you’re wearing any metal. Additionally, the day/night cycle is constantly running, and makes meaningful differences: nighttime brings monsters that spring up from the ground, it's easier to spot some useful bugs and plants, and other secrets that are best discovered for yourself. These are all constant reminders that you are always at the mercy of the world itself.\nYet there are still pockets of serenity and beauty spread throughout the gorgeous, tantalizing landscape. In these moments, subtle music queues matched the tempo of my adventure, swaying between playful piano melodies and ambient sounds of wildlife. In the foreground, Breath of the Wild’s anime-inspired art style is colorful, remarkably lively, and beautifully animated, but it comes at the cost of brief framerate hiccups and object pop-in that’s most noticeable when you’re playing the Switch in TV mode, where it renders at 900p, and when there are a lot of physics particle effects flying around the screen. The issues are less frequent playing on in portable mode on the 720p screen, but regardless of where I played the performance problems never significantly soured my gameplay. Performance on the Wii U version is roughly the same as the Switch, although it's important to note it renders at 720p. This makes the jaggies a little more visible and lighting appear slightly different. Otherwise, it looks good on Wii U.\nThe light and flexible cooking system offers lots of opportunity to experiment.\n“\nUnlike a lot of survival games in which every item you use must be created from felled trees and dug-up minerals, Breath of the Wild focuses all its crafting systems on cooking. It’s a light and flexible system that offers lots of opportunity for experimenting with different ingredient combinations to help you survive. Raw food and quick-and-dirty snacks cooked by a fire will replenish a small amount of health, but the most interesting and stat-boosting dishes come from tossing ingredients into a pot to make a hearty meal. I’ve spent many hours figuring out the best recipes by using clues noted in the ingredient descriptions to come up with effects like stamina boosts and elemental resistances of various potencies, and I loved that whenever I got a little carried away with the my recipes I ended up with a censored-out dish appropriately called Dubious Food that’s apparently too disgusting to even look at. Making buff-imbuing potions is equally as flexible, and you’ll find plenty of bugs and monster parts with which to mix up a special brew.\nWhat's the better The Legend of Zelda game: Breath of the Wild or Tears of the Kingdom?\nBreath of the Wild\nTears of the Kingdom\nAnswer\nSee Results\nThe art of cooking is a relatively small feature, but like Breath of the Wild’s other components, every piece of this sandbox feels meticulously thought out, and almost every action has a natural consequence that makes sense.\nBreath of the Wild’s skillful combat is as approachable as it is deep, but you’ll need to study its nuances if you want to survive in the late game. Link can still use swords, spears, and axes (as well as other amusing blunt objects) he finds in the world, but for the first time in the Zelda series they’ll wear down and eventually break from use, which fits perfectly with the survival angle. Especially in the early game, when most item durability is low, you’re constantly swapping out weapons, never getting too attached to one sword or hammer and always ready to improvise by, say, picking up a bony limb of a downed Stal Bokoblin and using it to finish off the last of a group of enemies.\nBreath of the Wild’s skillful combat is as approachable as it is deep.\n“\nBut no matter how prepared you think you are, you can still run into large Moblins and other enemies that can slay you in one hit. Naturally, as you make progress in the main quest you’ll gain access to empowering special abilities that will improve your chances to survive, but to say more about them would be spoiler territory. I like that Nintendo allows you to switch certain items off and continue using the most basic tools if you feel these are too powerful, creating an informal hardcore mode.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Which Game Is the Best?\nPick a winner\nTri Force Heroes\nZelda II: The Adventure of Link\nNew duel\nArchery plays a much bigger role in combat this time around, and it’s for the better. Link can quickly pull out his bow and take aim at enemies at any time, using a wide range of arrow types (like ice and fire) to take advantage of their weaknesses. The metallic ping you hear whenever you land a headshot is an immediately satisfying treat, as are the slow-motion attacks initiated by jumping off of high places and drawing your bow as you fall toward a batch of enemies below. Since the duration of this arrow-time effect is dictated by your stamina, early on it feels like you rarely have a huge advantage. A few stamina upgrades will buy you more time, but the stronger enemies you’ll face on the outer fringes of Hyrule can usually withstand several headshots, which brings it back into balance.\nThe way you can work the glider into combat is equally impressive and it makes for some engagingly versatile, skill-based action. Link can glide in, let go of the glider, and go into slow motion to fire off a few headshots, then grab hold of the glider again only to fall and downward-stab another unsuspecting enemy. The combat is open enough that it inspires more of the same playful experimentation as the world itself.\nBreath of the Wild tosses difficult encounters at you early on.\n“\nTense boss fights against larger foes are still a major highlight of the Zelda series, and Breath of the Wild tosses up more difficult encounters at you pretty early on, such as the imposing rock monster named Steppe Talus who will come right out of the ground. If you feel overwhelmed, you can always run away and come back to them later, and these emergent challenges add another welcome layer of danger to the survival sandbox. And you’ll find plenty more optional bosses well-hidden in this massive world.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Screenshots\nVIEW 8 IMAGES\nOn the other hand, dungeon bosses are challenging face-offs you can’t run away from. They’re as big on spectacle as ever, and my favorite ones involve ingenious combat puzzles where you need to use your Shekiah Slate, a powerful tool given to you early on that gives you special abilities like magnetising metal objects or creating bombs, to weaken the boss before you can take it down.\nThe Sheikah Slate is a major piece of the main quest, which puts Link on a journey to reclaim his memories of Princess Zelda after an apocalyptic event left Hyrule in ruins. It took me roughly 40 hours to slay the final boss and piece together what happened 100 years ago. While most Zelda games are rooted in heavy tradition, this coming-of-age story is anything but and has plenty of charming characters and surprises to reveal. It’s amazing that it works so well while letting you tackle its dungeons in any order you want.\nIt took me roughly 40 hours to slay the final boss.\n“\nHundreds of NPCs waiting to send you on side quests and puzzle shrines pepper the landscape, and there’s even more to discover hidden behind vague clues. The fetch-questy ones aren’t as elaborate as the bonafide rabbit holes of The Witcher 3, but they still introduce you to interesting characters and dole out helpful info, meals, and materials. My favorite quests involved piecing together a series of clues: in one example, a wandering minstrel sang a mysterious song that dropped hints as to the location of a special shrine. Some don’t even show up as quests in your log, so you have to pay attention.\nThe 10 Best Legend of Zelda Games\nVIEW 11 IMAGES\nPuzzle shrines yield their own useful rewards in the form of materials and handy weapon upgrades. These shrines involve short, inventive puzzle rooms which present you with a few clues and leave you to experiment in order to solve them. There’s a wide variety of them and a majority are excellent little puzzles to figure out, but a few of the combat-focused challenges are repeated and another handful use motion controls that just don’t feel quite sharp enough due to wonky physics.\nStill, the techniques you learn from shrines become essential training for Breath of the Wild’s fantastic dungeons. For the sake of avoiding spoilers I won’t go into too much detail, but these daunting, massive logic puzzles demand that you look at all the moving pieces in order to solve them. But every time I came across a new Shrine I was excited to uncover whatever new challenge it contained, with some Shrines in particular feeling as intriguing as early levels in Portal in the way they hinted at something much bigger and more impressive to come.\nThere are even more cryptic challenges throughout Hyrule, some hidden behind riddles, and others are large mazes or other inventive ideas. Even after 50 hours, I still can’t believe I haven’t seen almost everything, but the surprises keep on coming. I estimate it would take over 100 hours to solve every side quest, puzzle, and collectible. It is a truly massive game to tackle.\nVerdict\nThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterclass in open-world design and a watershed game that reinvents a 30-year-old franchise. It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. I’ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories. And even after I’ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I haven’t seen before. I’ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments.",

    "title": "Elden Ring",
    "review": "In the 87 hours that it took me to beat Elden Ring, I was put through an absolute wringer of emotion: Anger as I was beaten down by its toughest challenges, exhilaration when I finally overcame them, and a fair amount of sorrow for the mountains of exp I lost along the way to some of the toughest boss encounters FromSoftware has ever conceived. But more than anything else I was in near-constant awe – from the many absolutely jaw-dropping vistas, the sheer scope of an absolutely enormous world, the frequently harrowing enemies, and the way in which Elden Ring nearly always rewarded my curiosity with either an interesting encounter, a valuable reward, or something even greater. FromSoftware takes the ball that The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild got rolling and runs with it, creating a fascinating and dense open world about freedom and exploration above all else, while also somehow managing to seamlessly weave a full-on Dark Souls game into the middle of it. It shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone that Elden Ring ended up as one of the most unforgettable gaming experiences I’ve ever had.\nTo set the stage, all you know from the outset is that you play as a “Tarnished” of no renown, blessed by grace, and are compelled to make the journey to The Lands Between and become an Elden Lord. What that actually means, how one might go about doing that, and what the deal is with that giant glowing golden tree are all things that you have to discover yourself. Like other FromSoft games, the grand story is hard to fully digest on a first playthrough, especially because there’s no in-game journal to refresh you on the events, characters, or unique terms you encounter across dozens of hours. There really should be, but it is a story I nonetheless enjoyed trying to piece together for myself. I look forward to supplementing that knowledge with the inevitable painstakingly detailed lore videos that emerge from the community later.\nElden Ring Guide - 15 Things That Elden Ring Doesn’t Tell You\n8:01\nAutoplay setting: On\nElden Ring Guide - 15 Things That Elden Ring Doesn’t Tell You\nIt ended up being the organic side stories that kept me most enthralled rather than the grand overarching plot that credits Game of Thrones’ George R.R. Martin as its scenario writer. FromSoft smartly doesn’t change much in its approach to these from the Souls games, Bloodborne, or Sekiro; you’ll just naturally meet characters as you explore and discover the world and become involved in their problems. There are no “!” markers on the map, no waypoints to guide you to them, and these characters don’t always flag you down or initially want or need anything from you. They’re just people with their own agendas and goals, whose stories are impacted based on your own actions or inactions.\nI never once felt the open-world fatigue that usually sets in when my brain gets overloaded by a map.\n“\nThat was actually kind of refreshing in an open world as vast as this one, and it was always exciting to see a familiar face pop up again later as I was eager to learn about what brought them to this new part of the world and how their journey had progressed. The trade-off, of course, is that without any markers, quest log, or journal, it becomes very easy to forget about certain plot threads and accidentally leave them unresolved by the end. That’s a bummer, and I’ve already felt regret at missing out on stories that some of my colleagues have had – but for me it was worth it, because even after 87 hours, I never once felt the open-world fatigue that usually sets in when my brain gets overloaded by a map absolutely full of unresolved sidequest markers. Besides, any missed quests give me extra incentive to continue onto New Game+.\nUp until this point, which From Software game has been the toughest?\nDemon's Souls\nDark Souls\nDark Souls 2\nDark Souls 3\nBloodborne\nSekiro\nOther - tell us in the comments\nAnswer\nSee Results\n“Freedom” is the word that every aspect of Elden Ring’s design connects back to. From the moment you set foot in Limgrave, the first of many interconnected regions of The Lands Between, you are completely free to go wherever you want. And sure, that’s far from a new concept in open-world games, but the way it's handled here is truly extraordinary. If you wanted to, you could be an explorer and spend hours upon hours in Limgrave, delving into every mini dungeon, fighting every boss, discovering every NPC, and leveling yourself up to better prepare for what’s next. Alternatively, you could follow the Light of Grace, guiding you toward the main path and the first major dungeon – or you could find a hidden path to a new region that’s meant for higher levels and completely bypass the first major dungeon entirely! Maybe even steal yourself a cool weapon early while you’re there.\nA few things set Elden Ring apart from games like Skyrim that provide a similar openness.\n“\nAgain, this is not unprecedented, but a few things set Elden Ring apart from games like Skyrim that provide a similar openness. For one, Elden Ring doesn’t scale enemy levels to match your own at all, so jumping into a later region means you’re always dealing with stronger enemies, making the risk/reward prospect of doing so very real. But perhaps more notably, the way its different areas are connected makes finding these new ones more than a simple matter of choosing a direction and heading towards it. Limgrave is designed very specifically with a main path in mind that takes you through Stormveil Castle, and finding a way around that truly feels like you’ve discovered a hidden passage or alternate route, which is a super cool feeling not present in most open worlds I’ve explored.\nEvery IGN FromSoftware Game Review\nVIEW 50 IMAGES\nYou also have more freedom in how you approach combat than any previous FromSoft game thanks to a bunch of familiar new systems that are used in interesting ways here. Stealth is a more viable option thanks to the addition of crouch-walking, which finally lets you sneak by tough enemies or get behind them for a critical hit; there’s now horseback combat in large, open areas which gives you more mobility and the ability to attack on both sides with your right-handed weapon, but has the drawback of taking away your ability to roll out of the way of big attacks; you can craft items on the fly using materials found in the world so you can be ready for whatever a situation calls for; you can summon a large variety of creatures to fight for you, each with their own unique abilities and situational advantages; and most substantially, you can equip Ashes of War to your weapons and completely change their affinity and skill.\nElden Ring's difficulty surprised me, even as a veteran of the Soulslike genre.\n“\nThe Ashes of War system essentially combines two elements of prior Souls games – weapon affinities and weapon skills – by making them items that you can freely equip to your armaments. For example, let’s say I find a really good rapier and I really like the moveset, but I’m building my character with a focus on the Intelligence stat, which means it won’t get the kind of damage bonuses it needs to be a viable weapon. If I find an Art of War that bestows a magic spell onto a weapon, I can equip it and transform it into a magic weapon, thereby giving it Intelligence scaling on top of whatever skill the Ash of War has. Best of all, if I eventually decide to respec into a different build, I can still keep the same weapon and just put a different Ash of War onto it. Of course, you also have to find a specific item to unlock the different affinities, but it's nonetheless an incredibly smart addition that allows for a ton of variety in your preferred weapons.\nThe most important element of Elden Ring’s philosophy, though, is the freedom to just walk away and do something else when you hit a wall. Elden Ring is hard – which is to be expected from a FromSoft game – but its difficulty surprised me, even as a veteran of the Soulslike genre. I hit multiple points, even all the way up until the moment when I reached the very last boss, where I’d unlocked paths to several bosses and simply could not make headway on any of them. But even though I hit dead ends on those paths, there was always somewhere else I could go – a region I hadn’t thoroughly explored, an NPC quest that I had set aside for later, a Light of Grace indicator that I had not yet followed. There was never a point in Elden Ring when I was at a complete loss of what to do, and every time I explored those other regions and followed those alternate paths I would find new gear and items, level up my stats, or learn new spells or skills that would eventually give me the extra edge I needed to power through a boss that had given me problems.\nWhat We Said About Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice\nSekiro evolves From Software’s formula into a stylish stealth-action adventure that, naturally, emphasizes precision and skill in its combat. It walks the line between deliberate and patient stealth and breakneck melee combat against threats both earthly and otherworldly. Its imaginative and flexible tools support a more focused experience that shaves down some of From Software’s overly cryptic sensibilities without losing its air of mystery. Sekiro is an amazing new twist on a familiar set of ideas that can stand on its own alongside its predecessors. - Brandin Tyrrel, March 21, 2019\nScore: 9.5\nRead the full Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice review\nIt isn’t just the promise of making my numbers go up that called me to turn over every stone on the map: The Lands Between is positively brimming with riches, intrigue, and danger at every turn. Much of what Elden Ring’s open world does well can be traced directly back to things that made Breath of the Wild stand out from the many open-world games that came before it. (The PC version of Elden Ring also unfortunately borrows some of Breath of the Wild’s stuttery framerate woes). It’s that same feeling of starting out in a world with little explicit guidance, finding something that piques your curiosity on your own, doing whatever it takes to get there, and then being rewarded for that curiosity.\nIn Elden Ring, very rarely did my predictions come true.\n“\nThe big difference is that in Breath of the Wild I could usually predict what’s going to happen when I get to that orange glowy thing off in the distance. I’ll do a puzzle, unearth a shrine, do another puzzle, and probably get a cool temporary weapon and a spirit orb. That’s not to take anything away from Breath of the Wild – it was awesome, but that pattern became somewhat routine well before the end. In Elden Ring, by contrast, very rarely did my predictions come true. I’d head to a lake and all of a sudden get ambushed by a dragon, follow a river expecting to collect some minor crafting materials only to find a dungeon filled with enemies and traps, enter a cave and get ambushed by little goblin men, or take a seemingly unimposing elevator and find that it just keeps going down further and further and further… until eventually I found myself not in a small dungeon but one of its many awe-inspiring new regions.\nBest of all, each of these little excursions rewards your curiosity with something worthwhile. That could be a new weapon, a new Ash of War, a valuable consumable, a new creature for you to summon, a new spell, or a new NPC to talk to. There are so many valuable rewards available that I never felt disappointed by my prize, regardless of the amount of effort it took.\nI never felt disappointed by my prize, regardless of the amount of effort it took.\n“\nFromSoftware makes all of this especially painless thanks to a number of uncharacteristically friendly features. There’s a generous fast-travel system with a ton of points strewn all across the map; a marker system that lets you drop points on the map to denote things like NPCs, boss locations, out-of-reach treasure, materials, and more; and a speedy spectral horse named Torrent that allows you to quickly cover ground and easily mount and dismount as the situation requires.\nElden Ring: PS5 vs Xbox Series X | S - Performance Review\nElden Ring pushes some improvements in model quality, scene density, lighting, effects, and more compared to FromSoftware’s previous games. From a technical perspective, it is certainly up there with the best that team has made, even if the framerate can never reliably hit the 60fps cap it has set for itself. The Series S does lose out in such a GPU-heavy game, with basic level of detail culling being a key area the engine doesn’t do well. Buildings can stay visible and not swap to a reduced polygonal model or simply removed from render when far away, half-rate animations can still crop up at long distances on all platforms, and the rocky performance means Framerate mode and Quality mode aren’t as differentiated as they should be. If you have the choice then PS5 is the best all round option in all modes and game areas, but the Series X still offers a welcome boost over the previous gen and is never far behind enough to cause great concern. And while it’s not as smooth as it should be by modern standards, if you played Dark Souls back on the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360, then this is a silky-smooth affair by comparison. - Michael Thompson, March 3, 2022\nRead the full Elden Ring Performance Review\nBut the thing that’s most impressive about Elden Ring is that, in between all of this brilliant open world design, there are also a handful of Legacy Dungeons that still deliver those “wide linear” levels that Souls fans have come to expect. These are gigantic castles, forts, manors, underground labyrinths, and more that are packed with secret areas, challenging bosses, and multiple paths that are linked via one-way shortcut doors. If they were strung all together without being tied to an open world, they could probably exist on their own as Dark Souls 4.\nBottom line: Elden Ring’s open-world exploration is a new benchmark. It’s constantly exciting, rewarding, and full of moments that made me go “Holy shit” in a host of different ways.\nIt’s constantly exciting, rewarding, and full of moments that made me go “Holy shit.”\n“\nAs far as combat goes, Elden Ring is certainly closest to Dark Souls 3 when compared to other games in FromSoftware’s library of action-RPGs, characterized by weighty attacks, careful stamina management, and a bit of a slower pace than games like Bloodborne and Sekiro. The two big new additions are the ability to use a guard counter by blocking an attack with your shield and immediately pressing the strong attack button to follow up with a crushing strike that can leave weaker enemies in a crumpled state, and a jump attack which gives melee weapon wielders a new type of heavy attack that can also be used to stun enemies and leave them open for a critical hit.\nEvery 10/10 Game Review IGN Has Ever Given\nVIEW 66 IMAGES\nThey’re both great additions that offer melee classes fun new tools, but for the most part, FromSoftware has certainly adopted an “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” approach. What really makes the combat in Elden Ring so good though is its enemy design and variety. Not only are a fair number of them horrifying (not quite up to Bloodborne levels of grotesquerie, but still some weapons-grade nightmare fuel) but some of these baddies are absolutely vicious, coming at you with wild swings and combos that seemingly go on forever and can hit from 10 feet away. Others are more methodical and hide behind their shields to wait for the right opportunity to either parry you or catch you while you’re winding up. Others still are weak, but can be huge threats when they ambush you with a grab that kills in one hit. Many are designed to punish those who just mash the dodge-roll button without care, which makes Elden Ring a very hard game, but it’s a good style of difficulty; one that’s less about fast reaction speeds and twitch reflexes (though those certainly help) and more about learning, adapting, and finding the planted weaknesses in an enemy’s attack patterns. Deciphering those tells and acting upon each moment of opportunity is a large part of why these games are so much fun.\nAnd then there are the bosses. I don’t want to spoil them, but there are a handful that are some of the most visually and mechanically impressive FromSoftware has ever crafted. Some of the later ones got really close to crossing the line in terms of what I’d deem fair and reasonable when it comes to life-restoring second phases after already brutally tough first phases and two or three-against-one handicap battles, but fortunately, as mentioned before, any walls I hit were surmountable once I took the time to do something else and come back stronger.\nWhere to Buy\nElden Ring - PlayStation 5\n1\n$59.99\nSee it at Amazon\nVerdict\nIt is no exaggeration to say that Elden Ring is FromSoftware’s largest and most ambitious game yet, and that ambition has more than paid off. Even after 87 hours of blood, sweat, and tears that included some of the most challenging fights I’ve ever fought, and innumerable surprises, there are still bosses that I left on the table, secrets that I’ve yet to uncover, sidequests that I missed out on, tons of weapons, spells, and skills that I’ve never used. And this is all on top of PVP and cooperative play that I’ve barely been able to scratch the surface of. Throughout it all, while the fundamentals of combat haven’t changed much from what we’ve seen before, the enormous variety of viciously designed enemies and the brutal but surmountable bosses have brought its battles to a new level. Even with all the threads I didn’t manage to tug on my first playthrough (of what I’m sure will be several), what I was treated to can easily be held amongst the best open-world games I’ve ever played. Like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild before it, Elden Ring is one that we’ll be looking back on as a game that moved a genre forward.",

    "title": "God of War Ragnarok",
    "review": "How do you follow up on one of the greatest video games of all time? Sony Santa Monica finds itself in a situation not dissimilar to when Francis Ford Coppola created the sequel to his mob movie masterpiece, The Godfather. Like part two of the Corleone story, God of War Ragnarok puts a fierce, younger member of the family directly under the microscope. In doing so it manages to reach the heights of its predecessor and, in some ways, even tower above it. The writing, performances, and music are each exceptional, bringing this expansive Norse tapestry to life – but even as it holds your heart in one hand with its elegantly told story it’s crunching bones in the other with fantastically ferocious combat. It all binds together to forge a monumental action epic that adds yet another impressive landmark to the video game landscape.\nKeeping things broad and spoiler-free, Kratos' story picks up a few years after the final revelations of 2018's God of War – this is absolutely not one of those sequels where everything will make sense without playing the first game, or at the very least watching the included story recap (which is probably too brief to serve as anything but a jolt to the memory). The apocalyptic Ragnarok is coming, and its events circle around his son Atreus like one of Odin's ravens. Fimbulwinter – a time of unrest that presages Ragnarok – has very much come and, during the intervening years, Atreus has been growing stronger, learning about his Giant name \"Loki\", and trying to convince his father to trust him. There are touching callbacks to the hunting scene from the 2018 God of War as Kratos proudly watches Atreus prove that he’s no longer a child. But it’s no slow introduction: Ragnarok wastes no time in stepping into the action and, after a breakneck opening battle, the first step of this new journey is to leave the frozen realm of Midgard and find a missing Norse god in the broader and varied universe.\nGod of War Ragnarok Preview\nVIEW 18 IMAGES\nIt may not be as tightly told a story as 2018's, but Ragnarok has much grander designs. This is a sprawling epic that always keeps things on the move without ever becoming disorientating, gluing me to the edge of my seat as it repeatedly toyed with expectations. It's an ambition regularly met by stunning execution, with a momentum that never slips as you hurtle towards its bombastic ending. This journey took me just over 28 hours with a few fair side quests completed along the way, but with plenty still left to do afterward.\nProphecy and sacrifice swirl at the story’s centre as it repeatedly prods at the concept of destiny and whether blood runs thicker than the ink that pens it. It doesn’t merely offer up surface-level readings of these themes; instead, each character and their motives are given the respect they deserve by delving in deep. It’s a truly special and fittingly grand conclusion of Kratos’ Norse saga, as well as providing resolution to some of his more troubled Greek memories.\nIt’s a truly special and fittingly grand conclusion of Kratos’ Norse saga.\n“\nThere are twists and turns aplenty, with fakeouts and misdirection woven into the story’s fabric as it darts between loud spectacle and tender conversation. Characters old and new play their own crucial parts, including fresh characterisations of Norse behemoths like Thor and Odin, with a line of dialogue rarely wasted between them. These are truly unique depictions, and it's a credit to Sony Santa Monica and the actors playing each that I wasn’t reminded once of their MCU equivalents. Despite being laden with myth and melodrama, there's still plenty of time for welcome pockets of self-aware silliness that almost always elicit a laugh, whether that be another bizarre dwarven contraption or the simple thrill of Kratos eating a sausage.\nWhen not eating dinner, Kratos’ thunderous voice actor Christopher Judge frequently engages in smartly realised dialogue with his equally impressive castmates. Make no mistake, though: this is firmly Judge's court, and one he frequently dominates. Kratos' traumatic personal history is reflected in everything from his mournful tone of voice to his appearance - his Icarus wings are long-since clipped, but his complexion is still pale like a square of wall where a family portrait used to hang. Death weighs heavy in the winds that guide him on every journey he takes, whether delivering it himself or searching for some closure. The everlasting cycle of violence between parents and their children has long been a theme ever since the original God of War trilogy, although one that was only truly emphasised in 2018’s revival. Now it’s an inescapable fixture of Ragnarok; an exploration of the rawest and most human of emotions, and what happens when they are channeled through superhuman vessels.\nPain leads to anger, anger leads to hate – this is the genesis of the stalking threat embodied by the incomparable force that is a grieving mother. Portrayed incredibly with a newfound fury by Danielle Bisutti, Freya is a striking presence to be reckoned with in the sequel and casts a much darker shadow this time around. No longer just a helpful witch in the woods, she’s given a whole new spectrum of emotional depth to play in, and Ragnarok is all the better for it.\nEach character is given their own moments to shine throughout; Sunny Suljic fires back regularly with the sharp, teenage tongue of a brasher, more confident Atreus, and Alastair Duncan’s severed head accessory Mimir continues to provide levity and exposition in abundance. Various newcomers to the vastly expanded cast also deliver fantastic performances, with a particular standout being Laya DeLeon Hayes, radiating infectious energy from the mysterious Angrboda. Ben Prendergast brings warmth to the nuanced Týr – he's charmingly plucky as the Norse God of War. The foul-mouthed Brok and skittish Sindri continue to bring their unique brand of dwarven charm while granting you those all-important upgrades. They often provide pockets of humour, as well as a lot of genuinely helpful info along the way as they play a much more central role in the story this time around.\nAlso returning is composer Bear McCreary, whose score – like the dwarven smith brothers – goes hammer and tongs from the first moment to the last. There's some truly beautiful music to be heard along the journey, as well as explosions of raw orchestral power during intense fight scenes. The artistry bursting from every seam is astonishing – even when running in the high frame-rate favouring Performance mode – with excellent costume and world design on show. Ragnarok is incredibly well polished, with little details from the etchings on a dagger to the clunk of a cupboard door closing shown love. It’s expertly animated, with saliva-sputtering grimaces launching towards the lens during the heat of battle, and hair flowing realistically on Kratos’ less-follically challenged enemies.\nEvery 10/10 Game Review IGN Has Ever Given\nVIEW 66 IMAGES\nLayered writing, impeccable acting, and stunning set design are all crucial aspects in driving God of War’s filmic aspirations home, but they’re also never let down by the rock-solid technical craftsmanship at work. The one continuous camera shot style of 2018's reboot returns, snaking through the entirety of Ragnarok as if mimicking the world serpent Jörmungandr himself. The technique may have lost a little of its initial wow factor four years on, but it's still a remarkably impressive achievement that has several new tricks to show off, and only adds to Ragnarok's cinematic nature.\nA Song of Ice and Fire\nGod of War’s combat has always been the flashy attraction that draws a crowd in to be wowed by its story, however, and Ragnarok continues that tradition. It may seem familiar at first – and indeed some things remain the same – but it isn't afraid to play with expectations and throw a curveball your way. Kratos’ blades whip around in every direction, delivering a clanking firey pain to any face they meet. Heavy cleaves of his axe crunch into enemies, making them fold like bloodied origami. And yes, that axe still slices through the air, meatily lodging itself into anything unfortunate enough to be in its path, before being recalled to your palm with a hearty kick from the DualSense controller’s haptics in what remains one of the most satisfying button presses ever assigned to a controller. It's all unapologetically fast, and undeniably glorious – harking back to the brand of frantic action in which the series was originally rooted.\nIt's all unapologetically fast, and undeniably glorious – harking back to the brand of frantic action in which the series was originally rooted.\n“\nThere’s a fair helping of excessive violence on show, with Kratos willfully impaling and ripping apart any enemy put in front of him. Arenas are often tight spaces full of threats, and though you aren’t going to see the return of dozens of enemies on screen at once that spawn in wave after wave, that doesn’t mean there aren’t some aspects of those older games shining through. But even with that slight shift to old-school action, Ragnarok’s eyes are still drawn more to the shimmer of Nathan Drake's gold rather than Bayonetta's platinum. Cinematic spectacle takes precedence over the chaotic, bordering-on cartoonish action of old.\nThe axe feels largely similar to how you remember (and that’s no bad thing) with its dynamic mix of heavy attacks and ranged power, but how you wield the blades is noticeably different. There's a greater emphasis on using them to hook enemies and maneuver them around the arena – whether that be dragging them in towards you or juggling them in the air like the hottest of potatoes. They're much closer to how they felt in the original games; a nostalgic move set with a brilliant modern edge. The action feels and looks outstanding and there are no caveats or exceptions when I say that Ragnarok is only an improvement over God of War’s already ferocious combat.\nBoth weapons have new tricks to show off, too: you can “Frost Awaken” the axe by holding in the triangle button to power up your next attack, or mash the same button while the blades are equipped to ignite them. Locking down an enemy by freezing them with the axe before switching to the blades to unleash pain on their friends is an endless source of enjoyment. Even the shield is now more of an offensive tool, and different types can be bought and crafted to fit your playstyle. A sturdier one can soak up heavier hits, while a high-risk/reward version boosts your parry's effectiveness. Parrying has a delicious weightiness to it, and when you nail the timing, it still feels fantastic after the thousandth deflect. Trust me when I say that's a skill you'll want to perfect before taking on some of Ragnarok's toughest fights, as well.\nRunic abilities (special cooldown attacks assigned in your inventory) also return and, while there isn’t the same abundance of choice this time around, each is devastatingly effective. For example, Hades Retribution – a fiery stab that lodges a bomb into the ribcage of an enemy – is particularly fun to put into action. Brutal finishers on stunned enemies are another enjoyable throwback to the God of War of old. Heads are dismembered, waists are left standing and spouting blood, and torsos are carved in two. There's noticeably a good amount of variety in the randomly chosen, weapon-specific animations, too, so you won't get bored of seeing that one head stomp execution move from 2018 over and over again. My favourite has to be the simple pleasure of seeing the shock on a soldier’s face as their arms are hacked off one by one. Beautiful. Most importantly, all of these additions give an extra tactical edge as you mix up the cadence of your strikes and control each fight.\nKratos is a little lighter on his feet this time around, with a bit less of a thumping clomp to his sprint. Movement is further emphasised by the way you can now grapple up from a distance using the blades, and launch across gaps to dive into combat. Taller arena design literally adds extra layers to battles, allowing you to leap from a ledge to deliver death from above. Combat sequences can feel akin to Doom kill boxes as you dash and swing around elevated platforms toward your next victim in performances of acrobatic bloodshed – juggling cooldowns, Atreus’ arrows, and your rage meter to efficiently and spectacularly destroy everyone sent to stop you.\nEvery God of War Game\nA list of every God of War game ever made.\nSee All\nGod of War [2005]\nSanta Monica Studio\nGod of War II\nSanta Monica Studio\nGod of War: Betrayal\nSony Online Entertainment\nYou're required to think on your feet much more and take into account a vastly increased variety of enemy attacks and status effects such as burn, frost, poison, and many more that affect both you and your attackers. Each fight feels like a real occasion as you slalom your way through ranged, parryable, and unblockable attacks in order to sneak in a hit or two. Enemies can now perform powerful-but-interruptible attacks signified by a blue ring above their head in addition to their regular skills. A double tap of the shield will sort these out, but get your timing wrong and you're in line for some considerable pain.\nCombat really develops over time too, as small wrinkles and bigger game-changers are introduced throughout. Environmental strikes – such as ripping a jagged tree from the ground before swinging it like an oversized baseball bat – are often available to introduce to an unfortunate soul’s face. There are plenty of other big additions to combat that I won’t divulge so as not to ruin the sensation of discovering them yourself, but Ragnarok includes some of the most eye-catchingly colourful magic attacks I’ve ever seen in a game, beautifully destructive summon abilities, and much, much more. All are further examples of Sony Santa Monica's seemingly endless pool of creativity. Ragnarok has myriad more tools in its bag than God of War 2018 ever did, and is all the more enthralling for it. It all feels exceptional when in full flow, often mesmerising with its top-tier action drenched in rhythmic brutality, and is quite simply the best combat I can remember playing in a game.\nIt all feels exceptional when in full flow and is quite simply the best combat I can remember playing in a game.\n“\nAnd that just goes for the regular fights. Boss battles are of both a higher quantity and quality, including one encounter that makes the opening Stranger fight from 2018 look like a playground scuffle. There are definitely some of those huge boss fights that were so much more prevalent in the original trilogy this time around, with creatures regularly of a bigger scale than we saw four years ago. A lot of these one-on-one encounters are a true test of your capabilities as well, and even when playing on the Give Me Balance (medium) difficulty setting I’ve found myself needing resurrection stones far more than I did in the previous game. It’s not just the story bosses, either – I’ve fought massive alligator bastards called Dreki on more than one occasion, which are a real event to fight and more of a challenge than 2018’s trolls ever posed. It's great to see sprinklings of that old-school monster mayhem thrown into the mix, which manages to successfully offset some of the more serious stretches of the story.\nPuzzles offer much of what you'd expect – lodging the axe into objects to keep them from moving or freezing them to redirect water flows, burning vines to get elevators working, etc. Smart new puzzle ideas are consistently introduced, though, and build in complexity throughout as more abilities are added to your arsenal. They’re often fun and never in danger of slowing your progress to the detriment of the plot, but even so, Atreus or Mimir can come in with a hint far too early and sometimes rob you of that satisfying \"aha!\" moment. It's a very rare annoyance in a world where normally every last word is a joy to listen to.\nArmor customisation has been streamlined, resulting in the removal of the slotting system for a more straightforward upgrading mechanic. Enchantments are now placed inside a separate amulet rather than spread over various pieces of gear. This division makes seeing what you have equipped easier and means you aren't lost delving into too many menus within menus. This also means you can upgrade a piece of armour and take it with you through your journey if your playstyle happens to perfectly click with a certain set (or if you just love how it looks). I found myself changing up my builds regularly throughout, however, as I kept wanting to experiment with all Ragnarok has to offer. The same goes for weaponry, which can be upgraded, as well as fitted with attachments such as individually named hilts and handles, each with its own perks and bonuses. Who wouldn’t want to play with the Stonecutter’s Knob, after all?\nFurther experimentation is encouraged by the new skill token system, which allows you to add damage, stun, elemental, and other boosts to any unlocked ability. It really does feel more like you're being encouraged to build your Kratos this time around, rather than playing with a pre-designed action figure straight out of the box. It’s not stingy on the availability of resources needed to craft gear, further prompting you to inject your personality into a build. It’s an accessible level of RPG tinkering without ever becoming overwhelming.\nRealms Reborn\nRealms old and new are regularly a sight to behold – many looking torn from the pages of fairy tales, stocked with oversized flora and fauna. There's an extra effort to delve deeper into the mythology this time around and, as someone who's a fan of the Nordic source material, it's a real pleasure to see all of the different interpretations of creatures, people, and places they inhabit brought to life in all manner of delightfully weird ways.\nThe dwarven city of Nidavellir is a welcome rural change of scenery, with its many homes and tunnels that Kratos must amusingly crawl around in. It's at the centre of the rocky realm of Svartalfheim, where waterways weave through islets littered with bubbling geysers. There’s a real sense that the realm was ripped right out of the Old Norse Poetic Edda’s home of Iceland. Those geysers are also key to solving many of the puzzles in the region as you freeze them to create stepping stones and manipulate machinery – quirks like this help in making each place feel unique.\nSimilarly, fun new ideas are introduced in the returning Alfheim, such as reflective crystals that you can ricochet your axe off of to open doors or even use to blindside unwitting opponents in combat. It's a further example of not only each realm looking distinct, but also feeling distinct to play in from one another. Every location almost feels like a puzzle box that you’re gradually unlocking through a combination of brain and brawn as you make your way through it. There's also plenty to discover, with some realms surprising in their vastness. Exploration is encouraged via boat on the Dwarven seas, or via dog sled across Elven deserts. Once again, Metroidvania elements encourage you to revisit blocked paths at a later date once you own the skill required.\nThese new worlds bring with them dangerous new threats. If there were any faults to be found in 2018's revival, then modest enemy variety may well have been one of them. However, there is no such issue in Ragnarok, with its bestiary vastly expanded to accommodate all sizes and shapes of creatures. Familiar foes such as draugr and elves have made their way across, but this time they're joined by Grims which, you guessed it, are pretty grim scuttling toad people, and a personal favourite, the Einherjar; Aesir warriors who harness the power of the Bifrost that makes a section of your health bar glow before removing that chunk on the next hit. Each forms a part of a whole – there’s an engaging but never unfair difficulty curve throughout as you’re met with progressively greater threats.\nSide missions are sometimes spectacles in their own right. Standout Favours involve helping giant creatures in distress and adventures full of personal revelations through the lush jungles of Vanaheim. They are a great source of character development as you learn more about your friends and companions by helping them right past wrongs. Some side quests do just present a pure gameplay challenge over extra stories, however, such as hunting down powerful legendary enemies dotted across the realms of Yggdrasil’s roots.\nWhich video game sequel is the best?\nPortal 2\nMass Effect 2\nRed Dead Redemption 2\nHalf-Life 2\nOther (tell us in the comments!)\nAnswer\nSee Results\nThere is no shortage of genuinely tough side boss encounters, either. While I was perhaps taking them on too early out of eagerness, they were a great test of skill nonetheless. Chipping away at larger health bars is a really satisfying challenge and remarkably well-balanced against the standard quick-kill nature of the majority of Ragnarok’s fights. It’s yet another testament to the masterful combat design on display. And yes, there are some absolutely tough-as-nails, endgame-level challenges to rival the Valkyries of 2018, but I'm going to let you find out what those are for yourself.\nThere's a substantial slew of collectibles to clean up as well with Odin's Ravens, puzzle chests, artifacts, and much more to find in every corner. There's a ton to be done after the main story has been brought to a close, all of it incredibly moreish and fun to complete. Regardless of their nature, all of the optional content is joyously snackable. They not only flesh out the world of Ragnarok and riff smartly on the mythology, but also serve as valuable father-and-son time, with the end of the world creeping ever closer.\nGod of War Ragnarok delivers not only a chapter that reaches the lofty heights of its predecessor but leaves it impossible to imagine the series without it.\n“\nRagnarok never once rests on its laurels, throwing new ways to play at you until the very end. Despite having a seemingly endless amount to praise here, I really have barely scratched the surface of what God of War Ragnarok has to offer – I’m deliberately omitting dozens of secrets and surprises. I wouldn't dare spoil what's to come for anyone booting it up for the first time, but rest assured, there are both huge story moments and fresh gameplay additions that live up to and often surpass expectations. Taken all together, much like The Godfather Part 2, God of War Ragnarok delivers not only a chapter that reaches the lofty heights of its predecessor but leaves it impossible to imagine the series without it.\nVerdict\nAn enthralling spectacle to behold and an even more exciting one to take the reins of, God of War Ragnarok melds action and adventure together to create a new, unforgettable Norse saga. Impeccable writing, pitch-perfect performances, knockout action – it’s a complete work of art from top to bottom. Reflecting its core themes, it's everything a sequel should be: respectful of its legendary lineage, but not afraid to take it to exciting new places. God of War Ragnarok is an almighty achievement and creates a new high that makes many of its peers look positively mortal by comparison.",

    "title": "Cyberpunk 2077",
    "review": "Editor's Note: We've replaced the video version of this review with one that uses gameplay footage recorded on the PC build of Cyberpunk 2077, instead of the trailers we had to use previously due to CD Projekt Red's pre-release restrictions. The content of the review itself is identical, but the gameplay now more closely represents the experience we had while playing.\nEditor's Note 2:Due to the dramatic difference in performance, we've given a separate review score to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of Cyberpunk 2077. We do not recommend it on those platforms at this time.\nIn my experience, great open-world RPGs like The Witcher 3 or Skyrim aren't defined by the strength of their main story, but that of the side missions around it. With Cyberpunk 2077, developer CD Projekt Red has taken that philosophy and built an entire game out of it. Apart from the surprisingly short but still utterly compelling central questline that draws you through its diverse near-future cityscape, the vast majority of what you can do in Night City is entirely optional but often still extremely impactful on your journey. This more freeform structure isn’t without its faults, including loads of distracting bugs, but the strength of the missions themselves – optional or not – and the choice you have within them make Cyberpunk 2077 one of the most exciting, emotional, and just plain fun RPGs I’ve played in recent years.\nYou’re thrust into the shoes of V, a mercenary in Night City who (avoiding spoilers as much as I can) ends up with the psyche of long-dead rockstar and anti-corporate terrorist Johnny Silverhand trapped in their head. Johnny, played by the instantly recognizable Keanu Reeves, is a wonderfully dislikable jackass – even if, to be blunt, Reeves’ stiff performance is easily the weakest of an otherwise extremely impressive cast. Even still, Johnny’s confrontational relationship with V and the eventual growth between them is the anchor of this story as they fight to find a solution to the shared mess they find themselves in.\nPatches Since Launch\nUpdated 2/4/21\nSince publishing this review, CD Projekt Red has released multiple patches attempting to improve the performance of Cyberpunk 2077 and fix bugs. Multiple smaller updates were released closer to release, including the 1.06 patch we took a deep look at hare, with the larger 1.1 patch arriving more recently. Additionally, CDPR stated that next-gen versions are aimed for release in the second half of 2021.\nIt’s worth noting that the 1.1 update inadvertently introduced a different game breaking bug that quickly needed to be patched out as well, so while improvements are certainly being made issues haven’t gone entirely gone away. You can find a full 1.1 performance analysis here for an in-depth look at how these patches have changed the state of Cyberpunk 2077 at the time of this update.\nOnce I got past Cyberpunk 2077’s slow burn of an intro – it initially took me six hours to even reach the moment where the logo is splashed across the screen for the first time – I was all in on this story. That opening segment is slightly restrictive relative to what comes later, but it does an incredible job of creating a sense of investment in V’s struggle, and then keeping that going as the main quests slowly dial up the heat. Once past the intro, you can go wherever you want on the sprawling map that is Night City; certain neighborhoods may have tougher enemies than others, but generally speaking no one’s going to shoot you on sight unless you go looking for trouble – and from the early hours you’ll already have enough side quests to keep you busy for a long time.\nThe structure here feels very different from many RPGs I’ve played, including CD Projekt Red’s own The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. If most game structures are built like a redwood tree, with a tall central trunk that has paths branching off it as you go higher, Cyberpunk 2077 is more like a large bush: you don’t have to travel down its main quest very far at all to have dozens of tangled branches already within your reach, all competing for your attention. Most are just a phone conversation away, too: since this is the future, you often don’t even have to go looking for quest givers because people will just call to offer you a job. This does somewhat rob Cyberpunk 2077 of a familiar feeling of scaling growth, since the options available to you increase rapidly and then plateau a bit for most of your playtime, but there’s so much to see and do – and still so much not directly handed to you that must be sought out – that I didn’t mind trading in that style of discovery for one of abundant choice.\nThe intro did an incredible job of getting me invested in V and Johnny’s struggle.\n“\nAnd while the single, unrestricted urban map means you won’t get that “wow” feeling of traveling to an exciting new open world location at any point, Night City is so dense, diverse, and consistently beautiful that there are opportunities to stumble upon unexpected sights all the time within it – for example, I played for nearly 40 hours before I discovered there’s practically an entire forest hidden under one of the busiest interchanges in town. You’ll be sent through slums, fancy corporate towers, dusty deserts, lush greeneries, and even some weirder places that are better discovered for yourself. The scale and scope of Night City is simply stunning, and driving around marveling at everything it has to offer – from the massive skyscrapers to the immaculately detailed in-world advertisements that plaster them – is frequently rewarding on its own.\nCyberpunk 2077 PC Gameplay Screenshots\nVIEW 42 IMAGES\nIn fact, while there is a fast-travel system that gradually unlocks as you visit new areas, I almost felt bad about using it on anything but the longest trips. Driving manually means you’ll never see a load screen and lets you soak in the sights along the way. There’s some real variety in the feel and design of its cars too, each with a detailed interior that matches the depth of the city around them. And while you’re constantly being offered special cars for sale, all of which can then be called to you with the press of a button, some of the coolest options I won’t spoil are unique rides only unlocked through your actions in specific missions.\nDivergent Paths\nNight City is the kind of place where if you move through it too quickly you’ll miss half of what it has to offer. But don’t let the first-person perspective and guns-blazing futuristic combat fool you: Cyberpunk 2077 feels like an RPG through and through. It’s frequently a slow-paced game full of rich, beautifully presented conversations and an almost mind-boggling amount of choices to make – choice in dialogue options, how to build your character, how to approach missions, and beyond. I’d frequently reload saves to see how certain situations could have played out if I’d done something different, and what I found impressed me almost every time. Cyberpunk 2077 lets your choices have a massive impact on both V’s own story and those of the characters around them.\nAt one point I made a recommendation to a character at the end of a mission, and the next time I saw him I found out he had lost his job as a result – that wasn’t a fail state, as there was plenty more to do with him after, but knowing that his fate might look very different in someone else’s game where they’d picked a different choice made my playthrough feel more personal. Similarly, I was shocked to discover one of my favorite missions early on wasn’t even offered to another player because of a single decision we’d made differently. I was also floored when multiple decisions I made during a mission mere hours into the story massively changed the outcome of an unrelated one more than 25 hours later. I’d unwittingly turned what could have been an all-out gunfight into a friendly conversation.\nDon’t let the FPS combat fool you: Cyberpunk 2077 is an RPG through and through.\n“\nThe missions themselves are also largely delightful, ranging from hilarious to deeply emotional to thrilling to intensely dark. I don’t want to rob you of the experience of finding them yourself, but vague highlights for me range from the gorgeous parade CDPR has already shown off in trailers, to a series of gumshoe-style detective missions where the amount of evidence you actively seek out can have massive repercussions on the results (including one that was so grim it felt like playing out an episode of Criminal Minds). I don’t think I’ll forget a deeply touching scuba diving mission anytime soon, or befriending a goofy AI-controlled vending machine named Brendan. The fact that Cyberpunk 2077 is able to have deep, affecting moments alongside lighthearted goofs and blaring ads for things like “MILFguard” (itself an Easter egg pun on The Witcher’s Nilfgaard, though sex and nudity are an almost mundane part of Night City) without any of it feeling out of place is a testament to the strength of both its stories and the world they take place in.\nThe depth and variation available throughout most of these is genuinely hard to wrap my head around. You have to understand that in Cyberpunk 2077, just because something is a side mission doesn’t mean it’s not important to the story. This may come as a shock to anyone who has played CDPR’s previous Witcher games, especially The Witcher 3, but when I was mainlining the story it only took me around 20 hours to beat. That said, that only gave me access to three distinct endings, all of which were enjoyable but offered less control over the outcome than I would have expected. It was only after reloading a save from before the point of no return and spending another 20 hours playing through side missions, falling in love with characters, and leaving more of a mark on Night City that I went back to finish the story once again only to find my options had been massively expanded through my actions. After putting roughly 45 hours into Cyberpunk 2077, I was able to beat it seven different ways, including three drastically different final missions and five wildly different but satisfying endings after them (plus one similar one) – and I still have plenty more to do and lots of mysteries to hunt down. The more time you put in, the richer the payoff you’ll get in the end.\nCyberpunk 2077 isn't a Rubix Cube to be solved optimally, it's a Rorschach Test.\n“\nThis is the crux of what’s so impressive about Cyberpunk 2077. It’s not a Rubix Cube to be solved in an optimal way but with different routes to get there: it’s a Rorschach Test. It’s shorter than the epic-length quest you might’ve expected, but with an amount of variation that’s almost impossible to keep track of, so whatever you think you see in that inkblot is what you’re going to get out of it. There are no wrong answers here and nothing forcing you to play more or less than you want to. It offers you a marvelous amount of control as a player.\nThat said, this structure does misfire slightly in how it’s organized and presented. The mission log itself is a big messy list with no clear indications of what different tasks will reward you with or which optional jobs might be more pertinent to V and Johnny’s story than others. It’s primarily broken into “Main Jobs” that are required to progress, “Gigs” that offer amusing but quick and inconsequential bites of action and story, and a “Side Jobs” category that basically houses everything else, be it an important but optional piece of plot, a date with a side character, or just a series of bare-knuckle boxing matches. What’s frustrating here is that since all these Side Jobs are clumped together and optional, at a certain point I was at a loss as to how else I could impact the larger story and see more endings.\nDoes hearing Cyberpunk 2077 can be \"beaten\" in about 20 hours make you more or less interested in playing?\nMore\nLess\nNo change\nAnswer\nSee Results\nPart of that confusion comes from the three percentage trackers in the main menu, each relating to different aspects of V’s journey. While they are primarily increased through Main Jobs, some Side Jobs (but not all) could also occasionally move the needle as well. These ended up being fairly misleading to me, since the first time I finished the story they were at 90/25/40%, respectively. The issue here is that they are presented like numbers that reflect my progress toward individual goals, but don't actually function that way in practice. To be clear, I loved pretty much every single job I did, but these percentages mixed with Cyberpunk 2077’s freeform mission structure created a false and frustrating sense that I was failing to make progress even as I completed missions, with no indication of how to fix that.\nOnce I understood the system more clearly that frustration subsided a bit, though individual mission chains can still occasionally feel somewhat disjointed at times – like you’re playing through different movies that will then maybe affect the Avengers-esque culmination of V’s journey later on. But when taken as a whole, what Cyberpunk 2077 is doing here is pretty remarkable. Apart from a few recurring anchor points, different players could end up seeing wildly different versions of V’s story, twisting and breaking away from each other in ways that still feel entirely natural.\nBlade Gunner\nWhile that mission structure is undoubtedly the most interesting way Cyberpunk 2077 gives you control, there are also some good old-fashion RPG decisions to be made in terms of how you choose to kill (or politely incapacitate) those standing in your way. There isn’t any sort of traditional class system; instead, you invest points into five primary attributes, and then into perks within each of those for more specialized improvements. For example, if you’re planning to sneak through dangerous situations, the Cool attribute can make enemies detect you slower (I’m not sure why, but let’s just roll with it) and the Stealth perk page within that attribute is then full of additional boons to unlock, like increasing your crouched movement speed or unlocking an aerial takedown.\nEvery CD Projekt Red Review\nVIEW 13 IMAGES\nWhat’s great about this system is that these attributes and perks generally felt like they were only enhancing whatever playstyle I wanted to lean into, not punishing me for not investing in something else. Not having enough points in Body might make it harder to wield certain heavy weapons or mean you can’t bust open a few doors, but you can still effectively use shotguns even if you don’t invest in its Assault perk to make them stronger. In fact, each perk can level up through natural use – so if you put all your points in Intelligence to be a hacking master, but 10 hours in realize you’re really enjoying stealth, your Stealth perk will improve on its own somewhat whether you’ve invested in it or not. As with most things in Cyberpunk 2077, this system is wonderfully flexible and consistently rewarding, if a touch overwhelming in just how many options you have.\nCombat isn't the most complex dance in the world, but I had complete control over the choreography.\n“\nCombat itself is another aspect where you’ll largely get more out of it the more you put in. Like I said, despite how it looks in action, this is truly an RPG and not a first-person shooter. While I initially wasn’t in love with the gunplay because of its unexpectedly bullet spongy enemies and surprisingly quick damage drop-off at distance, it only got better the deeper I went. Perks let you improve those problems in statistical ways, but what really made the combat shine is when I started finding more unique weaponry and clever cybernetic augmentations that elevated things above simply pointing and shooting. Some guns can charge up and shoot through walls, and I invested in perks that made them both charge faster and hit harder. Alternatively, another player could lean into Smart weapons that cause bullets to seek out enemies. Add equippable Cyberware like the ability to slow time when you dodge while aiming, a double jump, or the savage Mantis blades, and things really start to get interesting.\nWhat's the Deal With PS5 and Series X Versions?\nI've only been able to play the PC version of Cyberpunk 2077 so far, but it's launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (and Google Stadia) alongside it. It's important to be aware that while backward compatibility allows you to play those versions on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and naturally take advantage of their faster GPUs and SSDs, there won't be official next-gen-optimized versions or upgrades for those platforms until sometime next year. CDPR hasn't said exactly when those will arrive, so you should keep that in mind if you're looking to play Cyberpunk 2077 on one of your shiny new systems this year.\nI wouldn’t say that combat ever becomes overly deep in the moment, especially the fun but fairly mashy melee options, but I (once again) had so much flexibility and control that I could constantly keep things fresh and entertaining for myself. I loved opening a fight by stealthily marking enemies then going to another room to blast at their outlines through a wall, switching to a powerful pistol for precise headshots as they tracked me down, then swapping again to my Mantis Blades to rush down the last few, all the while lobbing different elemental grenades and popping healing items behind cover when I needed to. It’s not the most complex dance in the world, but it’s one I felt I had complete control over choreographing.\nI also love Cyberpunk 2077’s solution for handling its unique Iconic weapons, which are generally awarded through missions and have distinct attributes and twists to set them apart from typical loot – things like the Chaos pistol that changes its elemental damage type every time you reload, the Overwatch sniper rifle that comes with a custom silencer, or… a dildo club called the Sir John Phallustiff. The clever part here is that, in addition to getting the item itself, you also get a crafting recipe for it (I rarely used the crafting and upgrade options across the 60+ total hours I've played, but there are whole perks dedicated to them for those who want to dig in deep). Through these, you can replace an Iconic weapon with a better version of itself as you progress, keeping your favorites relevant the whole way through the campaign. Some even have custom display spots in V’s apartment, giving completionists a visible reward even when not in use – though it is a little odd that the vast majority of the Iconic weapons I’ve found so far seem to be either pistols or katanas, causing a bit of awkward overlap.\nThe soundtrack is fantastic throughout, but the combat music especially stands out.\n“\nBetween the increased number of available weapons and ability upgrades, by the midpoint of my playtime I enjoyed going loud when I had to, but almost always tried to stealth through certain situations first if I could. Cyberpunk 2077’s level design is frequently a playground of decisions to make, be that finding which hidden entrance to quietly enter or which door to kick down and start firing through for maximum effect. There are tons of valuable items to pick up tucked into hidden corners, as well as computer consoles that can be accessed to turn off security cameras, open doors, or read emails that might offer clues to other things in the area. So while the stealth itself isn’t much more complex than crouch-walking out of sight and occasionally doing quiet takedowns, I loved puzzling out the best route and then using Quickhacks to mess with guards along the way.\nWhat's more important to an open-world RPG?\nA great main quest\nGreat side quests\nAnswer\nSee Results\nQuickhacking is Cyberpunk 2077’s way of blending hacking into its stealth and combat, letting you essentially pause time to use equippable viruses that can deal damage, mark enemies through walls, or even blind or deafen them temporarily. The enemy AI is fairly easy to manipulate at the best of times, but using hacks to quietly get through tougher areas or disable a stronger target mid-fight was always an awesome feeling regardless. That hack-stealth combo was my go-to playstyle, and with it I was able to complete some missions without ever drawing a weapon. There was one in particular that would have likely been a large, bloody base raid for a different kind of character, but thanks to my V’s high Technical Ability and a hidden shortcut I managed to find I never even saw a single guard on my way in or out.\nWhen things do get loud though, a special commendation needs to be given to Cyberpunk 2077’s soundtrack. The music here is fantastic throughout, with radio stations full of custom songs made by in-universe artists singing about the struggles of Night City like it was a real place, but the combat music stands out even in that company. It often drove the pace of firefights directly, pushing me forward and frequently making me bob my head to the beat as I leapt at people with Mantis Blades or shot them through their cover. A few choice sequences became truly memorable moments thanks to their soundtracks alone.\nBugs in the System\nUnfortunately, the amount of bugs I’ve experienced really does need to be mentioned. I’ve only been able to play Cyberpunk 2077 on a PC with a GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, and as of writing this I have yet to lay hands on either the PlayStation or Xbox versions, but the issues I’ve encountered were extremely frequent and distracting. Performance on Ultra settings at 1080p with ray tracing off was largely okay for me, as you’d hope would be the absolute bare minimum on a brand-new and still-hard-to-get graphics card, generally only noticeably dropping in framerate while driving around busy areas or in certain weather conditions – but it was the routinely messed up animations, missing models, and glitchy dialogue that really got to me.\nI’ve had important or emotional conversations undermined by the characters I was talking to glitching between incorrect poses, or the objects they were holding and referencing not load in at all. I’d frequently get phone calls in the middle of other conversations, causing two simultaneous discussions to overlap. I’ve had to sit through drives with my camera distractingly bobbing like I was in a run animation, and seen enemies (or even my own shadow on a wall) stuck in T-poses. And in the few important story moments you do get to see your own character model, I rarely had hair for some reason. Again, none of this stopped me from completing any significant quest (though I did have to reload saves in smaller missions a couple times due to bugs hindering progress) or from loving the stories being told, but it was still ridiculous and distracting, dampening a few moments that would otherwise have been powerful.\nCyberpunk 2077 - Examples of Visual Bugs\nVIEW 9 IMAGES\nA day-one patch will arrive after the time of this review, but CDPR has indicated it will focus on stability and performance – which is always good, but frankly those aren’t the issues that’ve been bothering me the most. To be fair, with its exceptional support of The Witcher 3, CDPR has absolutely earned a lot of faith that it will stick with Cyberpunk 2077 and continue to patch out these problems. But especially with that in mind, this does feel very much like a game that will be significantly more polished if you play six months or a year from now than it is today.\nJust to restate, a word of warning: we haven’t been able to play the console versions of Cyberpunk 2077 at all – not on the new-gen systems or the old. While I’d wholeheartedly recommend it on its gameplay merits, given the performance issues I’ve seen even with a high-end PC GPU, I am wary of what it’ll look like running on something like a launch Xbox One or PlayStation 4. If that’s where you intend to play, I recommend waiting until we can provide you with some gameplay footage from those systems before you make your decision.\nWhere to Buy\nCyberpunk 2077 - PC\n0\n$59.99 at Humble\nVerdict\nCyberpunk 2077 kicks you into its beautiful and dazzlingly dense cityscape with few restrictions. It offers a staggering amount of choice in how to build your character, approach quests, and confront enemies, and your decisions can have a tangible and natural-feeling impact on both the world around you and the stories of the people who inhabit it. Those stories can be emotional, funny, dark, exciting, and sometimes all of those things at once. The main quest may be shorter than expected when taken on its own and it’s not always clear what you need to do to make meaningful changes to its finale, but the multitude of side quests available almost from the start can have a surprisingly powerful effect on the options you have when you get there. It’s a shame that frustratingly frequent bugs can occasionally kill an otherwise well-set mood, but Cyberpunk 2077’s impressively flexible design makes it a truly remarkable RPG.",

    "title": "Red Dead Redemption 2",
    "review": "Red Dead Redemption 2 is a sprawling Western tale of loyalty, conviction, and the price of infamy, chronicling the inevitable collapse of a motley crew of Wild West holdouts kicking against the slow march of civilisation and industrialisation. Set in Rockstar’s most authentic and lived-in open world ever, there are so many things to do, so many people to meet, and so many places to explore it’s giddily overwhelming. Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t just Rockstar’s greatest achievement to date; it’s a game so lacking in compromise it’s tough to know where best to start discussing it.\nSo let’s start at the beginning: It’s 1899 and American outlaws are an endangered species. Dutch van der Linde and his gang are on the run after a botched heist in the growing town of Blackwater and they’ve retreated high into the mountains where an atrocious blizzard is covering their escape. We slip into the spurs of Arthur Morgan, an exceedingly cool and capable outlaw who was found by Dutch as a boy and raised on the wrong side of the law, and settle in for a roughly 60-hour story.\nEvery Modern IGN 10/10 and Where to Play Them\nVIEW 29 IMAGES\nIt’s a self-contained and linear introduction but it’s a clever one. The slick cinematics make a hell of first impression, embedding you in the gang and bringing you right up close to the characters who are doing their best to bellow over the howling wind. It also placed me in a distraction-free bubble while I learned some of Red Dead Redemption 2’s early controls and systems, which heightened the impact of having the full map open up to me a few hours later. The conditions on the mountain are almost claustrophobic, with visibility at a premium and thick snow trapping Arthur’s feet. Being set loose in the true open world after toughing it out in this intentionally oppressive environment really underscores the incredible feeling of freedom the full map offers.\nlabel=The%20Big%20Country\nAnd what a world it is; broader, more beautiful, and more varied than the one we explored in 2010’s Red Dead Redemption by a massive margin (though parts of that game’s map are also included). Ideally viewed on one of the best ultrawide monitors, there are snowy peaks and dank, alligator-infested swamps. Thick forests and open plateaus. Quaint homesteads and grand plantations. Narrow streams and great lakes. Dusty gulches and dim caves. There’s the muddy livestock town of Valentine, with its wooden buildings and rustic charm, and then there’s the imposing city of Saint Denis, a grimy and growing metropolis full of modern extravagances like electric trams, paved roads, and Chinese restaurants. The vast assortment of ecosystems and environments seamlessly stitched together here is nothing short of remarkable.\nRed Dead Redemption 2 does an exceptional job at slowly rationing out reasons to visit every corner of its huge world, too. I was still led to areas of the map I hadn’t yet visited even in the closing stages of its 60-hour main storyline. Because so many cards are kept up its sleeve, the joy of discovering new parts of the world is maintained throughout.\nThe ability of this game to keep itself fresh after so many hours is extraordinaryThe ability of this game to keep itself fresh after so many hours is extraordinary, and not entirely due to just the size and diversity of the world; it’s how alive all of those places feel. While the largely rural world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is far less dense than the likes of Grand Theft Auto V, it’s absolutely brimming with wildlife to discover, people to interact with (and potentially help), and places to scrutinise. The best kind of open worlds are those that seem almost indifferent to your presence in them; like life goes on whether you stick your nose into proceedings or not. I’ve sat and watched lumberjacks felling trees at a bustling logging camp and curiously tailed a perturbed Englishman wandering around town looking for his mate “Gav.” None of this is crucial to the progression of Arthur’s story; it just helps build a world around him that made me feel like a visitor rather than the centre of the universe. Red Dead Redemption 2 nails this in a way that few – if any – games have before.\nlabel=In%20a%20Valley%20of%20Violence\nThe slower pace of Red Dead Redemption 2 compared to something like the slightly more breakneck GTA V is also a big part of how it encouraged me to drink in all the world has to offer. Bodies have to be manually looted, and Arthur needs to physically manhandle a body to do so. Single-action pistols need to be cocked before firing. Guns Arthur isn’t currently carrying need to retrieved from his saddle. Coffee needs to be brewed before drinking it.\nI suspect some folk may regard this sort of stuff as chore-like, but I really dig it. There’s something methodical about it that really helps ground Arthur in the world, rather than have him feel like he’s gliding through it. For instance, I love the deliberate and mechanical process of cycling a new cartridge with a lever-action rifle via a second pull of the fire button – you can even pause for dramatic effect halfway through. Rockstar’s designers didn’t need to factor that in but I think they understand that tiny, almost trivial instances of subtle control like this subconsciously seat me into the world as Arthur even more.\nThe unhurried pace of checking vanquished enemies for goodies is an interesting design decision but I quite like the risk versus reward loot loop, to be honest. Do I dart around and pickpocket a dozen dead guys or do I just get the hell out of Dodge? They’re consequences you have to be prepared to accept either because your attention is needed elsewhere or because lingering around the scene of a crime naturally puts you at further risk of being discovered. Bounties don’t always come cheap. Did one of those fellas have a gold nugget in his trousers? Perhaps you’ll never know.\nAbout my only major logistical gripe is that the weapons I was previously carrying are regularly swapped out for others. Oftentimes it’s clearly mission-related to ensure you go into a task with a scoped rifle or bow when required, which is fine. More irksome are the times I end up with mismatching pistols for dual wielding, with the game trading out my preference. The admittedly brief bit of time it takes to swap back did elicit the occasional grumble from me.\nI spent a good deal of time off-mission simply moseying around, bingeing on the world like a virtual museumAt any rate, it’s seriously worth settling into the pace Rockstar is trying to set here because there’s just so much to see and hear. You’ll hear unique, one-time conversations that occur in camp after certain missions, as well as other bespoke bits of dialogue that reference recent events. Strolling through camp, I’ve been privy to everything from a heated bust-up between John Marston and his partner, Abigail, to the good-natured con man Hosea Matthews regaling the young Jack Marston with stories of his latest fishing adventure. This is all happening around Arthur whether you pause to eavesdrop or not. It makes the camp feel like a concentrated version of the world at large, a place with people going about their business and interacting with one another completely independently of you. I can’t understate the genuine feeling of life this injects into the overall experience for me.\nElsewhere in the world there’s still plenty for those who care to stop and smell the roses. Newspapers sold on street corners touch on the aftermath of Arthur’s exploits, as well as other things going on around the world. Much like in GTA V, you can visit theatres and take in some old timey entertainment. Dogs can be patted. I spent a good deal of time off-mission simply moseying around, bingeing on the world like a virtual museum. There’s simply too much to list.\nlabel=How%20the%20West%20Was%20Won\nThe main story missions themselves are a cocktail of high-stakes heists, deadly shootouts, desperate rescues, and thrilling chases, mixed with a lengthy list of other activities. Many of those function as organic ways to teach us about new side hustles and activities that can be undertaken, from selling stolen horses to playing poker or fishing.\nIt all feels great to play, similar in a lot of ways to its immediate predecessor but injected with a pile of new animations and multiple layers of interactivity. It asks a lot of the finite amount of buttons on a controller, but once I became accustomed to which commands require a tap and which require a press-and-hold I had few hassles. Shootouts are supremely cinematic thanks to plenty of gun smoke and the same style of on-the-fly, ever-changing death animations that have characterised Rockstar games since GTA IV. You can even shoot off people’s hats and pick them up later for yourself.\nI think there’s a common presumption that Red Dead Redemption is just GTA on a horse, but that’s a bit reductive. Certainly the GTA DNA is here, but with far more primitive firearms at your fingertips gun battles are more intimate and anarchic. I love the close range clashes, hunkered down behind bits of cover exchanging lead with enemies often just yards away, or slugging it out in bareknuckle scraps. It’s exciting and fun. Combat from horseback is equally well-handled and it’s always a grisly highlight to watch unfortunate saps go limp and tumble from the saddle in a seemingly endless number of ways. I think Arthur feels a fraction heavier than any of the GTA V trio, but I would not say that I found his movement cumbersome. I really like how connected Arthur feels to the world. I’m not a particular fan of that old-school, skating third-person feel – like the player character has no inertia – and that’s certainly not present here.\nDead Eye returns, naturally, as it’s been part of the series since Red Dead Revolver. It’s had some upgrades this time, the most useful of which highlights critical hit areas on a target (very useful for clean kills while hunting). It’s still a very effective way to make you feel like an unstoppable gunslinger and the gruesome ballet of slow-motion death-dealing remains disturbingly satisfying.\nI didn’t engage much with the available camp upgrade options – not the aesthetic ones, at least. There are some practical upgrades I acquired that had gameplay benefits attached, like a boat to go fishing in or a map at Arthur’s quarters that unlocks fast travel. I don’t feel like I missed much by opting out of purchasing animal skulls and rugs and such. This stuff feels a little more like a primer for Red Dead Online, the multiplayer component coming at an unspecified later date.\nI chose not to do a huge amount of crafting, either, and I was never really punished for it. You can craft tonics and satchels, and recipes can be discovered throughout the course of the story. However, I mostly made it through on purchased items, restocking in camp, and religiously ransacking dead bodies for liquor, health tonics, and cigarettes. (I created a lot of dead bodies.)\nTwo new elements I did take quite seriously were horse bonding and the honour system. The former is an inspired method of making you treat your horse with realistic respect instead of riding the poor thing off cliffs or parking it on train tracks for giggles. All horses are unique, and only the ones that trust Arthur can be relied upon to stay calm and not kick him off in the face of a predator or in a gun battle, and that trust is built by riding, brushing, and feeding it. I liked having to click in the thumbstick to reassure my horse when he was scared – it makes him feel real and establishes a physical-to-digital bond between you two. Your horse can die, too, and there’s no bringing him or her back if that happens. I kept the same horse from early in the game all the way to the finale and was truly attached to that big guy. Some of the other folk here have been less lucky and have had to endure the gut punch of euthanising their equine comrade (always pack some horse revivers, people).\nMeanwhile, Arthur’s personal honour is something that’s in the background at all times, rising and falling based on his actions in the world. In practical terms, being an outlaw who refrains from killing in cold blood and who helps regular folk around the world gets you discounts in shops and generally means you won’t have to look over your shoulder quite as often for bounty hunters and lawmen. Playing through as a vicious monster is also possible, although it’s not entirely clear to me whether there’d be some dissonance between that approach and Arthur’s actual story. I still need to investigate further, but I’m really happy with how my playthrough turned out and the outlaw-with-a-soft-side Arthur I chose to inhabit.\nlabel=Once%20Upon%20a%20Time%20In%20the%20West\nRed Dead Redemption 2 is an undeniably pretty game across the board. The lighting is fantastic, particularly in dark, misty situations where shafts of moonlight stab through the trees, and I love the way it handles Arthur leaving weakly-lit interiors into the temporarily blinding sun outside. The sunsets are especially spectacular and seem to vary depending on the weather system. Some are harsh and beaming while others are warm and soft. The facial animation is a noticeable step up from GTA V, and the level of granular detail is almost absurd, from the way blood smears on Arthur’s shoulder after carrying a kill to the way individual strands of his majestic mutton chops quiver in the breeze. The way wagon wheels become caked in mud. The way rust builds up on a poorly-maintained firearm. It’s another long, long list that speaks to a high level of attention to detail.\nNo matter where you look, everything feels meticulously handcrafted. Every consumable is labelled and can be picked up and inspected. Every catalogue in stores is full of custom text and illustrations pointing to products available for sale or old timey advertisements. Hallways are decorated with framed pictures I’ve never noticed repeated throughout the world. Remember: this is the game where horse testicles shrink when the weather is cold. More than once I found myself temporarily hypnotised by the musculature and skin creases on my horse’s butt. That’s a weird sentence, but you’re going to be spending a lot of time looking at a horse’s butt. It might as well impress you.\nNo matter where you look, everything feels meticulously handcraftedHorses are astonishingly well-animated and feel like genuine living creatures as they swing their necks, stomp their feet, and shudder their bodies on their own accord. That said, it’d be nice if the same self-preservation skills horses display when galloping towards a ravine kicked in when careening towards an obstacle in front – I definitely clattered into a few posts and fellow riders before figuring out my steed generally wasn’t going to avoid those on his own.\nlabel=Johnny%20Guitar\nEqually impressive is the audio, from the sound effects to the voice work to the huge library of music. Whether you’re expecting the satisfying metallic crunch of a reload, the iconic twang of a Hollywood Western ricochet, or the subtle squeak of a hotel floorboard, it’s all there. Bullets fired on mountaintops ring with cracking echoes, completely different to the sound of bullets fired indoors. There are a wide range of unique sounds that have been recorded to appear just once or twice across the whole of Red Dead Redemption 2, like the squeak of detonator wire being unspooled or the clink of bottles in the back of a moonshine wagon. They’re all constant reminders that little seems to have been missed.\nI also love how the world seems to be prepared for pretty much any action you can think ofI also love how the world seems to be prepared for pretty much any action you can think of. Turn around and walk straight back into a store you’ve just left and the shopkeeper will likely make a comment about how you’re back so soon. Leave a theatre before a film is finished and the ticket clerk will quip, “Seems you didn’t like that.” Shoot a polite howdy towards two people standing together and Arthur will use a plural term rather than a singular pronoun. It all contributes to a feeling of rare polish that’s even rarer in a game of this girth.\nAnd the music? It’s outstanding. Woody Jackson’s original score is top notch – an evocative mix of jangling Ennio Morricone-esque guitar and more soulful pieces better suited to patiently trotting through the world absorbing its mixture of beauty and ugliness. There are also a few occasions where non-instrumental tracks are used to excellent effect; one artist, in particular, was a big surprise to me and sings an impactful track during a key moment late in the story.\nlabel=The%20Wild%20Bunch\nThe plot thread holding Red Dead Redemption 2’s astonishing array of systems and gameplay opportunities together is Rockstar’s most serious and earnest story to date, and certainly the best written. It’s not essential to have played Red Dead Redemption to appreciate and understand what’s going on here, especially since this is a prequel story that takes place 12 years earlier, although I found it very rewarding being familiar with the larger plot as it connects to the eventual fate of the enigmatic Dutch van der Linde. Arthur’s relationship with Red Dead Redemption protagonist John Marston here is also particularly fascinating to me as a fan of the 2010 game, and it’s very well-handled. Marston is a crucial part of the story but Rockstar has been restrained enough to not spotlight him at Arthur’s expense.\nWe get to watch an incredibly nuanced performance as Dutch’s confidence ebbs and his restraint fadesEven better, however, is watching Dutch’s gradual descent from being the charismatic, successful, and clever leader of a gang of deadly outlaws to someone on track to become the cold-blooded and beaten man being hunted down by Marston 12 years later. We get to watch an incredibly nuanced performance as Dutch’s confidence ebbs and his restraint fades. Excellent, too, is main man Arthur: Not only is there an infectious authenticity to his low and smooth tone of voice, which seems perfect beneath the swept-back hair and enormous mutton chops I let him sprout by only ever shaving his chin, but when Arthur himself is a far wearier man by the story’s climax his delivery is doubly potent.\nEvery IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever\nVIEW 184 IMAGES\nThe whole cast is great, really. Antagonists like the Pinkertons on the gang’s trail are a little thinly painted and something about young Jack Marston’s sing-song voice didn’t sit right with me, but Arthur’s partners in crime all get swags of screen time; certainly enough to feel like convincing, three-dimensional characters that Arthur has a real relationship with. What’s more is that despite representing a wide range of folk from a variety of disparate cultures – from Irish thug Sean Macguire to Native American brawler Charles Smith – they all feel like credible human beings and not caricatures.\nCombined with strong writing and direction, the result is a game that’s sincere instead of satirical, and funny while remaining capable of some supremely well-earned emotional moments, especially throughout the truly excellent crescendo and epilogue.\nAnd even after completing the epilogue, which is split into two parts and longer than many whole games I’ve played in recent memory, I still have a stack of strangers that need helping, gangs that need killing, cheats to experiment with, and fish that need catching. There are 30 different types of fish in this game about cowboys. I’ve caught four.\nWhere to Buy\nRed Dead Redemption 2 - PC\n5\n$59.99 at Humble\nVerdict\nRed Dead Redemption 2 stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Grand Theft Auto V as one of the greatest games of the modern age. It’s a gorgeous depiction of an ugly period that’s patient, polished, and a huge amount of fun to play, and it’s combined with Rockstar’s best storytelling to date. Even after finishing the lengthy story I can’t wait to go back and play more. This is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era.

    "title": "Ghost of Tsushima",
    "review": "Ever since Assassin’s Creed started leaping from ancient Jerusalem to renaissance Italy to colonial America and beyond, there has been a longstanding itch to see the open-world stealth-action series take on feudal Japan. Consider that itch sufficiently scratched with Ghost of Tsushima. Sucker Punch’s latest is an absolutely gorgeous adventure through one of history’s most strikingly beautiful landscapes, and that beauty is compounded by one of the best blade-to-blade combat systems the open-world action genre has seen. There are some stumbles when it comes to stealth, enemy AI, and a few general minor frustrations, but for just about every moment where Ghost of Tsushima falters, there are plenty more where it soars.\nGhost of Tsushima is a fictional tale told with fictional characters, but it’s based on the very real invasion of Japan by the Mongol Empire in 1274 that began on the Island of Tsushima. You take control of Jin Sakai, capably acted by The Man in the High Castle’s Daisuke Tsuji, who starts off as a samurai before a disastrous battle against the invaders quickly teaches him that perhaps the honorable but restrictive ways of the samurai code might not be enough to deal with this new and existential threat.\nEvery Sucker Punch Game Review\nVIEW 10 IMAGES\nGhost of Tsushima revolves around this inner conflict as Jin’s formative teachings push up against his need to save his homeland at any cost, and though it takes a little while to really get going, it’s a compelling struggle. Even if Jin himself isn’t the most charismatic of protagonists, his foil, Khotun Khan, played by Glee’s Patrick Gallagher, has charisma in spades. He’s one of the most memorable game villains of recent memory thanks to his soft intensity that is oddly calming despite his terrifying intentions. He’s extremely cunning, always one step ahead, and his presence as the “Big Bad” is a large part of why Jin’s 40 to 50-hour quest for vengeance works so well.\nKhotun Khan is one of the most memorable game villains of recent memory.As good as the English voice cast is, though, it’s a shame that Sucker Punch wasn’t able to find a way to have the performance capture match the Japanese voice acting as well. As a result, if you choose to play with the excellent Japanese audio track, which features the outstanding Kazuya Nakai as Jin, it comes off as a comparatively cheap dub with wildly mismatched lip flaps and facial expressions that don’t mirror the emotion in the voice. It’s not a huge issue as it’s still well worth playing in Japanese – and you have the option of enabling the beautiful Kurosawa Mode, which puts a film grainy black-and-white filter over everything to match the style of the classic Akira Kurosawa movies that Ghost of Tsushima so effectively pays homage to. I wouldn’t recommend playing the whole campaign in Kurosawa mode, as there are some quests that demand some color recognition, but it’s a great visual effect to turn on every now and then.\nWhat isn’t ever a bummer is the music. The dynamic score seamlessly shifts from quiet and ambient shakuhachi flutes during stealthy moments to thunderous taiko drums once blades start clashing; tense encounters are made even more palpable thanks to increasingly speedy strums of biwas and shamisens. Overall, it doesn’t matter what you’re doing – the music always fits and serves to enhance whatever emotion the gameplay and the cinematics are trying to evoke.\nFight Like a Samurai\nGhost of Tsushima’s combat is like a witches’ brew made with bits of the Batman Arkham series, the pre-Origins Assassin’s Creeds, Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, and the entire library of Kurosawa films. And, as witches’ brews tend to be, the result is magical. Like all great combat systems, it’s simple to understand on a surface level: there are light attacks to quickly deal damage and beat out slower strikes, heavy attacks that deal more damage and can break through enemy guards, a block button to guard against certain attacks, and a dodge button to avoid the attacks that can’t be guarded.\nThat probably all sounds familiar, but the glue that holds this combat system together and allows it to remain interesting the whole way through is the addition of the stances you can shift between at the push of a button. As Jin completes certain tasks, he’ll unlock new sword stances that each come with their own movesets, and, more importantly, their own strengths versus a particular type of weapon. The starting Stone Stance is ideal for dealing with swordsmen, as one charged-up stab attack can sneak through their guard and either kill them outright or deal massive damage. Later on you’ll learn the Water Stance, which uses slower but more powerful strikes that can break through the defenses of shield-wielding enemies.\nThere are four stances total, and once you have access to them all combat will challenge you to not only identify the greatest threat at any given moment but also to swap to the stance that is best suited to deal with them, all while balancing the very real need to play defensively. When it’s at its best, combat in Ghost of Tsushima is fast, chaotic, tactical, and is true to the fantasy of being a lone hyper-skilled but outnumbered samurai.\nThe little touches go a long way towards combat's exquisite feel\nThe little touches go a long way toward combat’s exquisite feel, in addition to bringing a bit of visual spectacle. The on-screen HUD is minimalist and the camera always stays really tight so you can get an up-close view of the action; enemies have clear audio tells so that even if you can’t see them you know when to dodge or block; fatal attacks often end with Jin spinning around to face the camera while your enemy stumbles around with blood spurting out before finally keeling over. Even smaller still, defeated enemies will sometimes crawl helplessly on the ground desperately trying to escape you, you can wipe the blood off your sword, you can bow to pay respect to your opponent, and the list goes on and on.\nThe best part, though, is that there’s no traditional level-based stat progression. When you get stronger in Ghost of Tsushima, it’s not because invisible numbers went up and now you deal more damage and take less when you’re hit; it’s because your techniques got better and now you have new, better ways of dealing with tougher enemies. It’s so incredibly satisfying. When you level up you might spend a point to unlock the ability to block a previously unblockable attack from spear-wielding enemies, or you could choose the ability to block arrows so you can better deal with situations where you’re surrounded by archers. Or maybe you’ll unlock the ability to make enemies flee in terror when you execute a perfectly timed Sekiro-esque parry.\nIt’s fantastic because it means that you’ll never run into an area in Ghost of Tsushima where, all of the sudden, you’re getting one-hit killed by archers who you’d previously brushed off, or having to spend a week chopping away at the sword equivalent of a bullet sponge just because they’re arbitrarily several levels higher than you. Crucially, this removes the problem of being forced to grind sidequests in order to reach a certain level minimum in order to progress in the story, which is something that certain other games are notorious for.\nWhich open-world action/adventure has the best melee-centric combat system?\nThe Witcher\nBatman Arkham Series\nSpider-Man\nThe Lord of the Rings Shadow of Mordor/War\nSleeping Dogs\nOther\nAnswer\nSee Results\nImpressively, Ghosts of Tsushima’s difficulty always managed to be appropriate no matter what point of the campaign I was at. Enemies do get tougher, and you do need to improve your gear by upgrading your sword, armor, and charms to meet the difficulty curve, but the stat improvements from gear always felt secondary to the skills that you’d accumulate, but and the challenge always felt fair. Even when I bumped the difficulty up to hard mode, which makes enemies more aggressive, it never took away from the lethality of my sword.\nOn top of all of this, there are also the various tools and gadgets that you earn over the course of your adventure. As Jin gets more and more comfortable with bending his samurai code and using tools outside of his normal repertoire, his combat abilities also expand dramatically. He can use kunai much like Batman uses his batarangs to quickly interrupt or eliminate weakened enemies; he can throw sticky bombs to disorient a large crowd; or he can take out his trusty bow and land a headshot to bring down a heavily armored foe in one hitpotentially end the fight before it even begins. The sheer variety of ways to approach combat in Ghost of Tsushima is incredible.\nStealthy Stumbles\nIt’s a good thing that the blade-to-blade combat in Ghost of Tsushima is so good, because Jin’s ninja-inspired stealth does not hold up its end of the bargain. It works, on a very basic level, in all the ways that you’d expect it to: you can crouch-walk through fields of tall grass to invisibly sneak around enemy encampments, you can assassinate foes from above, and you can even buy upgrades that let you take out multiple enemies at once if they’re all foolishly clumped together.\nThe problem is what happens once you get spotted. Enemies just don’t know how to handle it. What if you climb onto a rooftop? They don’t follow you, they don’t hunt you, they kind of just yell and throw shurikens. What if you suddenly break line of sight and crouch into a nearby flower patch that they can still clearly see? They just turn around, look elsewhere for a bit, and then blow their little alarm horns. It’s as if you do anything other than just fight once you break stealth, the AI just throws up its hands and shrugs.\nJin’s stealth tools are also very rudimentary and don’t allow you any sort of creativity that might make stealth a little more exciting. They all kind of do the same things, just with different ammo types. There’s a wind chime that works as a distraction on a single enemy and a firecracker that works as a distraction for a group of enemies. Then there’s your bow that silently kills enemies, your longbow that silently kills helmet-wearing enemies, a dart that silently kills enemies and makes them puke blood, and another dart that makes enemies try to kill each other. There are also a handful of mandatory stealth segments which just boil down to finding the clearly laid out stealth route and occasionally using distractions to clear enemies out of the way. None of the flexibility and versatility of the melee combat is found in the stealth gameplay.\nBy the late game I was taking five enemies out at the start of every fight, and it felt awesome every time.Fortunately, Ghost of Tsushima offers a way to make going loud right out of the gate just as advantageous as picking off a handful of enemies unnoticed, and it does so in the best possible way: by staying true to its samurai cinema roots. At the beginning of most combat encounters you can trigger a stand-off, which allows you to target one of your enemies in a classic showdown where you must wait for them to make a move to attack, and then strike with one of your own to take them down in one hit. If you nail the timing, that’s one fewer for you to deal with when the brawl begins. But that’s only the beginning: you can make these stand-offs a major part of your combat strategy by putting points into the stand-off technique and wearing armor that allows you to chain multiple stand-off streaks together. By the late game, I was taking five enemies out at the start of every fight, and it felt awesome every time.\nOf course, there is a risk involved with stand-offs: they’re absolutely devastating if you lose. Your health is drained almost nothing and you’re put in a position where you’re surrounded by all of the still very much alive enemies in the area. That risk gets greater later on as enemies start throwing in feints to try to make you swing early. It’s an all-around fantastic mechanic that not only fits with the samurai theme, but also takes the fun but typically disadvantageous tactic of just waltzing in through the front gate of an enemy encampment and makes it potentially just as rewarding as silently going through an encampment and stealthily clearing out a bunch of guards.\nUtsukushii\nOpen-world games can often feature some of the most beautiful virtual landscapes there are, and Ghost of Tsushima is right up there with the best of them. It may not quite meet the promise of its 2018 gameplay reveal trailer, but this is still a stunningly gorgeous game. Every scene is densely packed with grass, trees, leaves, and flowers all gently blowing in the wind every which way you turn. The island of Tsushima is teeming with natural beauty, which makes it a joy to explore even if you don’t have a particular destination in mind.\nSucker Punch’s design encourages exactly that, with traditional waypoints being integrated into the environment instead of a UI overlay. Following a plume of smoke will always lead you to something worth investigating; a tree with different-colored leafs off in the distance will always yield some sort of reward; and following a trail of Torii gates will never disappoint. It’s all refreshingly organic, much like how it was in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, especially considering that even when you do set a waypoint from your map to head toward a specific quest or location, instead of following arrows on the screen you’ll follow the direction of the wind.\nSidequests are interesting in Ghost of Tsushima because there are actually several different types. The first and most common are your typical garden-variety tasks called Tales of Tsushima, which are short stories that have Jin going off and being the good and honorable samurai that he wants to be by helping people with their problems. Though the stories and characters in these sidequests are largely forgettable, at the very least they don’t seem like they’re just being churned out and used as padding. These are often thoughtful enough to be more special than they might initially let on thanks to some often unexpectedly dark turns and occasionally interesting gameplay scenarios. One, for example, is really the only time where I was literally surrounded by archers and nothing else. They were all spaced out on different levels of two opposing cliff sides, making it a fun and unique challenge that’s not replicated elsewhere.\nTales of Tsushima are more special than they might initially let on\nOne level above that e Tales are multi-part, character-specific sidequests that basically span the entire campaign and serve to give each major character their own story arc. This includes Sensei Ishikawa, the renowned samurai archer searching for his missing student; Masako, a grief-stricken mother out for revenge on those who murdered her family; or Yuna, the thief who saved your life at the very beginning of the story and will do whatever it takes to save her brother from the Mongols. Each of these sidestories reflects an aspect of Jin’s own journey, and it’s very interesting to see both how they develop and the impact they have on his development. Some of the later ones that I’m not allowed to talk about due to embargo restrictions are especially touching and deal with some pretty heavy subject matter, with one in particular that makes exceptional use of Ghost of Tsushima’s scouting mechanic in a very clever and emotional way.\nEvery IGN PlayStation First-Party Exclusive Review\nVIEW 239 IMAGES\nTales of Tsushima typically reward you with charms that boost a certain aspect of your character, allowing you to spec into specific character builds like stealth, tanky, or a focus on critical hits, and so on. In the early going these charms were a great incentive to complete sidequests, but once I had pretty much all the charms that were needed later on, these Tales of Tsushima sidequests lost much of their appeal from a reward standpoint. I lost the desire to seek them out.\nThe Mythic Tales sidequests are some of the best moments in all of Ghost of Tsushima.Finally, there are the Mythic Tales. These are epic sidequests that have you hunting down legendary techniques or pieces of gear, and they’re obtained by listening to a musician tell the legend of whatever it is you’re seeking to earn, shown through some extremely cool animated sumi-e cutscenes. From there, they sprawl out to epic quests that each vary wildly in their design, but all are well worth playing through. Especially because their rewards are among the best boons you can get, whether it be the Heavenly Strike special move that has you channeling your inner Kenshin Himura as you dash through an opponent with a lightning-fast sword strike, or a new piece of high-quality armor that grants powerful perks like stand-offs having a chance to terrify enemies and cause them to run away. But even without those incentives, these quests are still some of the best moments in all of Ghost of Tsushima.\nMy favorite thing about exploration, though, and something that I especially appreciate as someone who’s not typically big on collectibles, is that every major collectible has both a worthwhile reward and a fun mini challenge tied to it. I was always extremely eager to find new Bamboo Strikes, not only because they gave me more resolve (a resource needed to heal and use special moves) but also because I just loved doing the little button-press minigame required to collect them. Shrines are even better because in addition to being the only place where you can find major charms (which offer dramatic buffs and perks strong enough to potentially design a whole character build around) they are also the only areas that you’ll be able to find those signature Sucker Punch platforming sections familiar from the Infamous or Sly series.\nGhost of Tsushima Photo Mode Slideshow\nVIEW 62 IMAGES\nThe minor collectibles, like Mongol artifacts, journal entries, sashimono banners, and pillars of honor, are less exciting – they only offer some minor cosmetic items or flavor text. But they are plentiful enough that they still provide some added value for trophy hunters – and at least Ghost of Tsushima makes hunting them very easy thanks to the ability to quickly fast-travel to any discovered point of interest on the map.\nAfter reaching the credits, I still eagerly put in another 15 to 20 hours to finish up.It took me between 40 and 50 hours to play through Ghost of Tsushima (it’s hard to say for sure as it doesn’t track your time played), which included completing all of the Mythic Tales, a complete liberation of Tsushima from Mongol control, all of the multi-part supporting character sidequests, and most of the of the standard Tales of Tsushima. After reaching the credits, I still eagerly put in another 15 to 20 hours to finish up the remaining sidequests (except one that is apparently bugged for me, but Sony says will be fixed in a pre-release patch) and find all of the collectibles in the hopes that the final reward would be worth it. It wasn’t, which is a bummer because there’s otherwise not much to do in the post-game – no New Game+ and no unlockable difficulties for a second playthrough. It’s a bit aggravating that even if I did decide to just play it again (in Kurosawa mode, for instance), you still can’t skip any of the cutscenes.\nFinally, can we talk about photo mode for a second? Because Ghost of Tsushima’s photo mode is the one of the best I’ve ever seen. Partially because the world is just so pretty that it lends itself well to being captured in its natural beauty, but also because of the unique touches that Sucker Punch added, like the ability to have animated background environments or to add a large selection of particles like leaves, fireflies, or even songbirds. You can change the weather, alter the time of day, add clouds, create a camera flight path to create short videos – and all of this on top of all of the essential photo mode options like exposure sliders and filters that have become standard. My one disappointment is the fact that the customizable emotions that you can put on Jin’s face could stand to have a little more… well, emotion. But nonetheless, Ghost of Tsushima’s photo mode sets a new high water mark.\nVerdict\nGhost of Tsushima is an enormous and densely packed samurai adventure that often left me completely awestruck with both its visual spectacle and excellent combat. By steadily introducing new abilities instead of stat upgrades, its swordplay manages to stay challenging, rewarding, and fun throughout the entire 40 to 50 hours that it took me to beat the campaign. A few aspects are surprisingly lacking in polish in comparison to other first-party Sony games, especially when it comes to enemy AI and the stealth part of its stealth/action split. Still this is an extraordinary open-world action-adventure game that solves several issues that have long gone unaddressed in the genre, while also just being an all around samurai slashin’ good time.",

    "title": "Deltarune",
    "review": "Note: this review contains some small spoilers for Deltarune's first two chapters.\nIt was nearly seven years ago on Halloween when I woke up at the crack of dawn to download an ominous “Survey Program” from Undertale developer Toby Fox. It turned out that this program contained not just a simple survey, but the start of a grand adventure that I haven’t been able to stop thinking about since. Now, with the release of the third and fourth chapters, that adventure has truly started to take a more solid shape. Deltarune carries on the spirit of its predecessor by subverting expectations of the RPG genre in the wildest ways. It also shares the same sort of clever, heartfelt, and often absurdly hilarious writing, not to mention a truly unforgettable soundtrack. Don’t be fooled by its deceptively humble pixel art and initially simple plot: there’s a surprising amount of intrigue, beauty, and unpredictability just under the surface. The unsettling questions Deltarune raises about our relationship to the characters we control in games provides an engrossing layer of meta-commentary, while still celebrating the indomitable willpower and heart of extraordinary RPG heroes.\nThat aforementioned creepy survey demo ended up only being the first chapter of Deltarune, with the second released in 2021, and finally the most recent two arriving just last week as part of its more traditional “full” release – although, that’s not to say it’s “finished” now, as more chapters are planned to arrive as free content updates in the future. But no matter if you are picking up where you left off years ago or starting fresh from the first chapter, you’ll be unceremoniously thrust into the body of a weird teen named Kris. There are a lot of similarities to Undertale here, but also more than enough differences in its setting and how battles work to set it apart. Where Undertale had you navigating an underground society of imprisoned monsters you either had to fight or befriend, Deltarune begins in a pleasant but unremarkable “Hometown” – though for some reason you’re still the only human around in a world of monsters. The only epic struggles to be found here are trying to stay awake through class, or dodging the extreme embarrassment of seeing your divorced adoptive monster parents run into each other at the store.\nWhat We Said About Undertale\nIt's hard to express just how much I adore Undertale without spoiling anything significant, but that's what I love about it. It tells its story in such a dynamic way, and with such a great understanding of the RPG player’s mindset, that it couldn’t have been told in any other way. It's a masterfully crafted experience that I won't forget any time soon. - Kallie Plagge, January 12, 2016\nScore: 10\nRead the Full Undertale Review\nIf you played Undertale, you might get a kick out of seeing several of that game’s more notable figures living regular lives in this parallel story, but I wouldn’t quite say it’s required. In fact, I’d argue that Deltarune is at its best when it’s not trying to focus on what came before it – funny as those interactions may be. I’ll admit, at first I was a little disappointed to see familiar faces appearing in what was supposed to be a new adventure, but then I realized these aren’t simple fanservice cameos. In another universe, these were imposing boss monsters – kings and queens with terrifying strength and magical powers. Here, they’re just… ordinary townsfolk: teachers, bored police, and struggling shop owners. While they may have a role to play, this story isn’t truly about them.\nIt’s a great touch how even the menus and UI change to reflect this new realm.\n“\nInstead, things kick off when Kris and a rude, crude monster classmate named Susie find themselves transported into a world of fantasy straight out of an ‘80s adventure movie. Here, pencils and bandaids transform into swords and armor, while forgotten classroom toys or computer lab accessories spring to life as “Darkeners”, many of which will stand in your way. It’s a great touch how even the menus and UI change to reflect this new realm. The environments you’ll find yourself exploring in these “Dark Worlds” are anything but: they’re filled with vibrant and beautiful pixel art backdrops that work in harmony with a stunning soundtrack to capture the themes of these fascinating places.\nHappy Feet, Dumbass\nIt’s not long after arrival in the Dark World that you meet your third “party member:” a lonely Darkener prince named Ralsei who seems to know all about you, and gives you the grand spiel about cleansing dark fountains and saving the world from destruction. You know, hero stuff. To get to your goal, you’ll have to fight your way through enemies, frenemies, misunderstood goofballs – pretty much everything you can think of. As with Undertale, you’ll learn that the path to victory can be forged with turn-based violence or pacifism, but the long-term consequences aren’t as clear cut here. Striking enemies into submission allows you to get stronger quicker, though finding ways to spare opponents will lead to your own Dark World’s Castle Town becoming populated with now-friendly occupants, and may even change how certain scenes play out.\nTruly, the best part of battles is the ability to “Act” on your turn – winning over an opponent with enough mercy to spare them, in between dodging an ever-expanding variety of deadly bullet patterns on the enemy’s turn within the confines of a box that pops onto the screen. On paper, this system could easily lose its charm, but here it’s kept entertaining by exceptionally witty and context-sensitive execution. Each foe has different needs that get more complex (and often wacky) the further you delve into these adventures.\nThings may start with you ordering a party member to flirt their way toward mercy, but it wasn’t too much later I found myself up against tougher ambulance-themed adversaries. Asking Susie to “Act” instead gave me a challenge: dodge the ambulance-themed bullets on the enemy’s turn to earn more mercy for a risky play (because she doesn’t trust doctors, naturally). Whereas Ralsei’s “Act” would suggest getting hit on purpose instead (because they’re here to… help?), which wasn’t a bad call if I was having trouble dodging already. It’s moments like these where Deltarune’s creative juices are at their tastiest, combining fun contextual commands that blend limitless humor while leaning into the personalities of both your team and the Darkeners you’ll face. Each new encounter left me eager to see what my Fun Squad could come up with, and with a mix of plentiful enemy variety and Dark World areas that never stretched on too long, I never really found myself getting tired of the opponents I came up against.\nEven beyond fighting and ACTing, I really came to appreciate how Deltarune’s three party members allowed me to develop synergies and tactics as time went on. Later battles became delicate dances of assigning heals or items, then having one person ACT so that another could spare on the same turn (provided my ACTs were successful). Even the process of dodging incoming attacks provides a new layer of strategy with the ability to “graze” the bullet patterns by moving my little heart icon alongside the attacks or dodging at the last second without getting hit to build a meter necessary to perform certain magical powers. Just like ACTing, certain magic could change depending on the battle to accommodate new strategies and challenges unique to that fight, and often made the risky play to get close to attacks worthwhile.\nThe Power of Page Breaks Shines Within You\nEven when I wasn’t fighting, there was a lot to explore both in and out of the Dark Worlds I visited. Being able to wander around, talk to people, and interact with objects isn’t exactly a new RPG idea. (I have vivid memories of obsessively checking every trash can in a Pokemon game, often leaving disappointed.) But what I believe sets Deltarune apart is the confidence it has in making its world worth stopping in to smell the roses. You might find a container of Ice-E’s Cool Boys Body Spray “Spray For the Boys” Flamin’ Hot Pizza Flavor under the bathroom sink, for instance. Deltarune’s hilariously illogical humor oozes into every corner of the world like some sort of weird goop that’s actually kind of delicious and also addictive for some reason. It’s so intrinsically linked with everything else – combat, dialogue, story, puzzles, you name it – that I couldn’t imagine this adventure being any other way. Seriously, in what other setting would you encounter a weird little dolphin attacking you with internet pop-up screens in reference to some obscure 14-year-old meme about a desktop image trying to lure you into downloading viruses?\nWill You Play Deltarune Before it's Fully Finished?\nStopped After the Chapter 1 + 2 Demos\nGoing to Play Chapters 1 - 4\nAlready Played all 4 Available Chapters!\nWaiting for the All Chapters to Release\nAnswer\nSee Results\nIt’s not just the jokes, either (rampant as they may be); I found myself constantly intrigued by the world being set up around this adventure. Not all of it is laid out in big, showy cutscenes and plot developments. There’s a level of reward that is given to those willing to inspect things they may otherwise walk right past, or talk to someone you may not expect to have a nugget of wisdom to give. It’s a type of detail that doesn’t seem all that impressive at first glance, and yet I’ve come to appreciate immensely during my time in each of the four currently available chapters. Even something as random as inspecting an innocuous patch of moss can steadily grow into its own running gag between chapters, which feels like I’ve uncovered a special secret. In this way, Deltarune is also rife with small, personal moments and anecdotes that allow its characters to shine in a way I rarely see anywhere else.\nEach place you visit is accompanied by an embarrassment of phenomenal music.\n“\nEvery location has these touches, and the areas I explored on my quest to seal the dark fountains led me through some pretty fantastical interpretations of otherwise ordinary places. The plush carpet of a forgotten classroom became a vast red forest with fields of rippling purple grass, while a computer lab transformed into a larger-than-life shining city of lights and superhighways built from advertisements, and all of it works wonderfully in the distinct pixel-art style. Deltarune is careful about keeping its scope in check, and instead saves moments of visual flair for just the right occasion when you least expect it. Even the amount of expression seen in its character portraits continued to delight me at just how well they were able to convey the right emotions, which only got better and more expressive each chapter.\nEach place you visit is accompanied by an embarrassment of phenomenal music, and as with Undertale, the payoff of Fox personally composing the music in addition to developing so many aspects of Deltarune is clear to see. From its incredibly funky and catchy battle theme to the ethereal exploration of the first Dark World and the upbeat tunes beyond, every new area you’ll visit is a treat for the ears. There’s a wonderful mix of chiptunes in all sorts of genres, and each boss encounter theme somehow surpasses the last with no signs of slowing down. (Did my ears deceive me, or did I hear the TMNT: Turtles in Time soundfont being used?). It’s not just that the music is great, but its decisive inclusions elevate the material with careful use of leitmotifs to tie events and characters together. In one of the later chapters, there are certain rare sequences that bring out the raw emotion of a live piano playing, and left me floored at how well it empowered the scene to reach greater emotional heights.\nIt’s Pronounced, “The $!$? Squad”\nIt’s hard to pick which characters to talk about in a cast that’s so colorful. Whether it’s in the relatively normal Light World, or the dream-like Dark World, the assorted monsters I met made a lasting impression on me. So many of Deltarune’s cast members are actually very, very dumb (in an extremely endearing way, I promise!), and incredibly distinct in ways too numerous to count. Many times, it almost felt like a Royal Rumble of competing scene-stealers, with new challengers arriving all the time. I’d always get a sinking feeling that there would be no way a new chapter could top the previous one’s antics… and yet, each time I was proven wrong in ways I literally could not have expected from both new and returning faces. I still don’t even know if I like Rouxls Kaard (that’s pronounced “Rules Card”) as a person, but I’ll be damned if he didn’t leave me in tears every time he popped up – usually against everyone else’s wishes.\nBrendan's Favorite Games Featuring Goofy Little Dogs\nSeemed like a good idea at the time.\nSee All\nUndertale\nTobyFox\nGhost Trick: Phantom Detective\nCapcom\nPikmin 4\nNintendo EAD\nBut I can’t not talk about the true “Lightener” stars of the show: Kris and Susie, one of my favorite teams I’ve had the pleasure of commanding in turn-based battles. They both go through some very different personal journeys over the course of each chapter, and though we still don't fully know where they lead, they continue to fascinate me. Kris, Susie, and yes - even Ralsei are each loners and outcasts in their own ways, and seeing them form a bond powerful enough to shake the pillars of Heaven has been immensely satisfying.\nThere was a point early on where I worried that Susie’s own character growth would sputter out too soon after calming down on the more extreme ends of her bullying tough girl act (which is expertly woven into Deltarune’s mechanics to manifest in clever ways both in and out of combat). Instead, I found a wild card. She’s as much the main protagonist of this story as Kris is… sometimes perhaps even more. Susie continually forges her own path when it suits her, leading to surprising revelations and tweaks on how Deltarune plays. She won’t even let you remove gear from her without giving her something else to equip – she’s that feisty! And yet, for all her bark, she makes a wonderfully vocal stand-in for us, going from annoyed disinterest to full-throated enthusiasm as she embraces her role in the story, and her newfound friends.\nThey are truly a dumbass duo with joint custody of a single braincell. \n“\nHer relationship with her classmate Kris is also something I never get tired of. It encapsulates some of the funniest, most heartwarming, and most sincere parts of Deltarune’s story so far. I can’t count the number of times I inspected an object and was presented with the option to do something profoundly stupid, only to have Susie right there beside me, excitedly goading me on. They are truly a dumbass duo with joint custody of a single braincell, and the enthusiasm they share for the absurd is inescapably contagious.\nKris on their own is also a fascinating enigma, and explaining why will require a light amount of spoilers from the first two chapters. I hope you’ll forgive me on this, but it’s also one of the central parts of Deltarune’s themes, and how you play it. You can click on the spoiler tag below to read more.\nSHOW SPOILERS\n\n\nI don’t want to say more about how your role continues to escalate in later chapters, nor do I wish to spoil much of the contents of Chapter 3 and 4. What I will say is that Chapter 3 felt like a demented roller coaster ride that somehow seamlessly inserted an entirely new way to play that was an absolute blast. Chapter 4 continued to step on the gas pedal, but not in the ways I was expecting – it was more like riding the aforementioned roller coaster into the gaping maw of a dread-inducing abyss. It does have a few slower parts, especially navigating some of the more maze-like areas that seemed to lack the usual unlockable shortcuts until the very end.\nHowever, nothing prepared me for the harrowing end to Chapter 4. The story remains unfinished, yes, but in no way did I feel let down by it ending where it does for now, having surmounted some incredible odds and witnessed some jaw-dropping moments to get as far as I have.\nVerdict\nToby Fox and his team have really accomplished something incredible with Deltarune and its new chapters, even if that accomplishment isn’t quite finished just yet. The fact that what appears to be a halfway point in the story can leave off on such a phenomenal and high-stakes note after roughly 20 hours still has me reeling knowing I’ve yet to see the true depths of where this adventure will lead. Though I have my own share of theories, I’m highly confident that no matter what Deltarune’s true ending holds in store, its incredible and well-refined culmination of captivating characters, hilarious and earnest writing, and stellar music has already left one hell of a lasting impact I’m not likely to forget.",

    "title": "Tetris",
    "review": "The game that sold a million Game Boys is back! This is Game Boy Tetris -- the Tetris for nostalgic Nintendo fans. The version that was included as the free pack-in game with the original Game Boy handhelds way back in 1989.\n\nIt's a brilliant game. Nintendo made one of the best moves in the history of the gaming industry by pairing the new portable with this spectacular puzzler, as Tetris was a perfect fit for play on the go – tons of people got hooked on this game 20 years ago. Seriously, it was a phenomenon. You think Angry Birds is huge today? That was Tetris back at the dawn of the '90s. A megaton hit.\n\nThis particular version can no longer compare against more modern revisions in terms of featureset – newer releases like Tetris DS, Tetris Party Live or Tetris: Axis are all packed to overflowing with extra modes, online multiplayer and more. And in fact, this 3DS Virtual Console edition of Game Boy Tetris has had a chunk of its content cut – since Nintendo's VC re-releases are still not supporting multiplayer, you can no longer go head-to-head against a friend here (which is particularly sad, since Tetris was the game that actually established two-player Link Cable play in the first place.)\n\n\nSo Tetris has its negatives, granted. But I still think this re-release is spectacular, deserves your attention and demands four of your dollars – because it's the Tetris!\n\nReally, this one wins on its nostalgia. That's a factor in all Virtual Console re-releases, of course, but this one is magnified in that regard – because everyone had this game before. Everyone – every Game Boy owner across a whole generation of the industry. Its audience was huge. Its impact on pop culture more pervasive, more engrained than even the Mario and Zelda releases of the same era. And if you think that a thin argument, I dare you to do a quick Internet search to bring up this game's iconic background music and see if you can resist the pull of reaching for your wallet.\n\nBeyond just pure wistfulness for the old days, though, this Tetris really does succeed in several other areas. It's the core Tetris game, the design that's been so endlessly replayable that it's gone on to inspire over two decades' worth of spin-offs and sequels (let's see if anyone remembers Angry Birds in the year 2033). It includes both endless mode (A-Type) and a 25-line score attack with adjustable levels of garbage blocks (B-Type.)\n\n\nAnd Tetris has also benefitted quite a bit from being presented through the new 3DS Virtual Console emulator software. Its Restore Point functionality is interesting to use in a puzzle game – you can cheat and artificially increase your high scores to a certain degree by scouting out several pieces ahead and then resetting back to an earlier save state – but more intriguing is the simple power to now suspend your session in progress.\n\nThis lets you do two things – first, you can get several minutes deep into a run through endless mode without worry that a need to leave your game idle will ruin a high score in the making. And second, you can save your high scores. That seems such a simple thing, but the original Tetris Game Boy cartridge didn't have battery back-up – so you could enter your name next to an impressive point total, but it would always get erased every time you powered off your system. There was no permanent way to track your scores. Now, that issue's resolved – simply leaving Tetris by way of the Home Button on the 3DS will also keep the same session of the game saved and active, so you can put up scores for weeks, months and years now without fear that a drained set of AA's will delete all record of your achievements.\nVerdict\nTetris endures. It was one of the greatest video games ever made when it first appeared back in the '80s, and it retains that status to this day. This particular version of Tetris just adds to that sense of awe, as it's inarguably the most important and nostalgic edition of the game ever published. I was shocked and surprised that Nintendo decided to re-release it here on the 3DS, and I'm pleased to recommend it once again to all old-school Nintendo fans looking to relieve a bit of an era gone by – or to any newer Nintendo fans who just want an affordably-priced, straightforward version of a truly excellent puzzler.",

    "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time",
    "review": "The new benchmark for interactive entertainment has arrived. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, the fifth official installment in Nintendo's popular action adventure series is finally here, and like its NES predecessor in 1987 it is a game so enjoyable, it has the power to pull videogame players into its imaginative worlds -- and refuse to let go for days. Call us crazy, but when the final version of Zelda 64 arrived in the IGN64 offices, we stopped working, locked ourselves into a room with a big-screen TV and a surround system and played 17 hours straight. After only a few hours of sleep, we were back for more and we couldn't stop until we finished the game. Then, we started over again to find all the secrets.\nRarely is there such a perfect mixture of graphics, sound, and gameplay that even the most cynical players will admit that Zelda 64 is poised to shape the action RPG genre for years to come.\n\nGameplay\n\n\nLike all games in the Zelda series, Ocarina of Time follows the adventures of a young boy named Link. After a nightmare involving a certain young princess and the evil thief Ganondorf (who eventually turns into the horned creature known as Ganon), the elven boy wakes up in his home village tucked away behind the mysterious Lost Woods. The only Kokiri without a fairy, Link soon meets up with his new traveling companion, the winged Navi, and sets out on the adventure of his life. The quest, which inevitably turns into a rescue mission for Princess Zelda, leads players through dark dungeons, picturesque villages, into the heart of a volcano, to the bottom of a lake, through a haunted desert, deep into a magical forest, into a giant tree, the belly of a beast, and even through time. To say that this game is huge is an understatement. Every time you discover a new corner of the Kingdom of Hyrule, you'll be amazed at the detail, the richness of scenery, the many things to do, and the amount of thought that went into designing it all. For example, players can spend hours just exploring a village, talking to the inhabitants, solving puzzles, and looking for hidden items.\n\nAs soon as you pick up the controls for the first time and start to explore the vast universe that makes up this latest creation from the hands of Shigeru Miyamoto and team, you know you're in for a treat. At first, the control is very reminiscent of Super Mario 64, the game that single-handedly invented 3D platformers as we know them. But Ocarina of Time is not a platformer, a fact that takes some getting used to when trying out Link's various actions. There is no jump button. You can still jump at certain points in the game, but it is not integral to the gameplay that players actually control the jump themselves. Instead, Ocarina of Time introduces an auto-jump feature where Link will jump the last possible moment when running toward a ledge. It sounds annoying in theory, but it works very well for this type of game.\nThe gameplay objectives will be instantly familiar to friends of the series. Push walls to find hidden rooms, use bombs to uncover secret passages, shoot arrows at certain objects to open doors, and so on. But Ocarina of Time doesn't only imitate its predecessors, it innovates at every corner. With the use of the ocarina (a clay flute), players need to play certain melodies to solve riddles or warp to new places, and even engage in numerous games of \"Simon Says\". When you bring out the ocarina, the controller's button layout actually mirrors a real ocarina, with the Z button acting as the bottom hole on the flute. To allow for a little more fun, the designers also added a pitch bend and modulation option via the analog stick. Compare Zelda 64 to other titles and you will find that even one single dungeon has more puzzles than all the levels in many other games combined.\n\nThings really take off once Ocarina of Time introduces the ability to travel back and forth in time (very much like light world/dark world gameplay). Without giving too much away, consider this one: at one point in the game, you talk to a character as adolescent Link, who tells you that a young boy with an ocarina did something seven years ago. Then you go back in time and actually do it. Or how about a fully functional fishing game, with Rumble Pak support and realistic fish behavior? This mini-game is so good, any other company would have released it as a game of its own. Then there is the ability to ride a horse -- it's so addictive, you'll catch yourself just galloping around and jumping fences. Or how about involving sword fights with a multitude of enemies that block your attacks with their shields? A shooting gallery? A super-cool hookshot that lets you traverse deep ravines? Secrets involving the use of sunlight and mirrors? Want to light some torches? How about catching the spirit of a slain ghost in a bottle? Changing daylight and weather conditions that affect the gameplay? The ability to wear different masks? Rumble Pak vibrations that give away the locations of hidden caves? It's all there. Oh, and let's not forget about teasing chickens... No matter which way you look at it, Ocarina of Time is simply unmatched when it comes to the variety and diversity of actions and puzzles. Do yourself a favor and play this game without the use of a guide! It's a lot more rewarding when you finally get your hands on something that you've been looking for for days than to read about it in a guide.\nThe camera follows Link in a style similar to Mario 64. Like in Mario, the camera also zooms out to reveal Link's surroundings at times -- but that's where the similarities end. In order to give players more control over the viewpoint and enable better, more focused 3D fighting, Nintendo reached deep into its bag of tricks and came up with an innovative feature. First of all, tapping the Z button will force the camera behind Link, no matter where you are. Incredibly, clipping is kept to a minimum and the camera logic almost always guarantees a good view of the action. But there is more.\n\nWhen you see a character or an object that interests you or you're being attacked by an enemy, press the Z trigger. This will bring up a rotating yellow cursor that locks onto your target. Now, as long as you don't press the Z button again (or turn away to break your lock), the camera will stay on your target, retaining its over the shoulder position. This allows you to circle your enemies and slash at them while side-stepping, back-flipping and shielding yourself from the onslaught. While you are locking on to a target, the screen will become slightly letterboxed to let you know that the target mode is active. To additionally help you keep track of your attackers, your fairy Navi will hover over the target's head. There is also an alternate camera setting that requires you to hold down the Z button to keep a lock, but your fingers will probably get tired after a while. Needless to say that the Z button feature works impressively well and is sure to find its way into future 3D games. Ingenious.\n\nThe upper C button will let you either switch to an alternate camera angle (inside houses or towns), or zooms in to let you look around.\n\nThe attack system is equally impressive. Pressing B will make Link draw his sword. Press it again to slash at your enemy once. Press it three times to swing the blade from the bottom to the top. Press forward and B to slash downward. Turn the 3D Stick in a circle to do a roundhouse slash. And once you found the proper \"power-up\", press and hold B to charge your sword and make it glow, then unleash a nice helicopter slash that's sure to turn any stinking skeleton into a heap of bones. Similar controls are available for the other items, which can be distributed over any of the lower three C buttons. Press the corresponding key once to draw the weapon or item, then press it again to attack. For the projectile weapons (such as the bow or the boomerang), the designers also added an optional first-person perspective, kind of like the sniper mode in GoldenEye.\nBut the crowning feature is the context sensitive A button. If you stand close to a ladder, the A button display at the top of the screen will change to climb or descend, if you run around freely, it will change to jump, stand next to a sign and it turns into read, and so on. Simply pressing the button will activate the function. Some of the available functions include open, pull, push, dive, check, talk and crawl. This A button feature is Nintendo's way to keep things simple and to deal with the limited selection of buttons on a standard console controller. Once in a while, the automatic selection will cause you to do something you weren't trying to, but 99% of the time it works perfectly fine.\n\nOnce you get used to the radically different camera system and button control, navigating the environments and fighting against enemies becomes second nature. Many of the problems that plagued Mario 64 in the camera and control department are a thing of the past, and there is virtually nothing that distracts from Zelda 64's immersive gameplay. Being able to explore the wide environments, climb hills, fight monsters, pick up and use items and discover new areas becomes second nature fairly quickly and soon you will feel right at home Hyrule. Add to that an interesting quest, tons of mini-games, hidden items (how about a two-fisted sword that doesn't break?) and enemies (100 hidden spiders, anyone?) and a compelling storyline with plenty of time travelling. Sure, you can probably blast through the title in around 30 hours, but it's easy to see why some gamers are spending in excess of 80 hours to complete the title.\n\nThere is absolutely no question about it. Ocarina of Time is the best game on the N64 and we can't think of any game that we'd rather play on any other system.\n\nData Management\n\n\nThe Zelda 64 cartridge, which is also available in a limited gold edition, comes with a built-in EEPROM that lets you save three different files on the cart. There is no need for a separate memory pak.\n\nGraphics\n\n\nRemember how impressive it was when you jumped around in the 3D environments of Super Mario 64 for the first time back in 1996? With Zelda 64, Nintendo is raising the stakes considerably. Once you step into the Hyrule fields, blinded by the early morning sun, you will be mesmerized by the incredible scale and depth of the landscapes. Rolling hills extend all the way to the far horizon, with Hyrule Castle barely visible in the hazy distance. After a few minutes, the sun will set, it will get dark, and the moon slowly rises in the sky. Far, far away, a wolf howls and skeletons with red glowing eyes ascend from the earth.\nThe graphics are incredible. Whereas Nintendo concentrated on framerate and speed with F-Zero X, Zelda 64 is all about detail and visibility. There is no fog. The towns are highly detailed with elaborate wall textures that are directly affected by Link's glowing fairy, Navi, and the beautiful day/night changes. Characters animate fluidly and display several different expressions on their faces. While the framerate and texture design is not always up to par with Rare's Banjo-Kazooie (the blurry marketplace scene comes to mind), the polygonal environments, colors, and visibility are the best yet seen on the system.\n\nIn addition to the many wonderfully designed enemy characters roaming the dungeons and levels, Zelda 64 also pushes the limits of the console with oversized bosses. If you heard a loud thud on Monday, November 23, then it was our jaws hitting the floor when we first laid eyes on Ganon. Stick with this title and you will see temples and dungeons that seem to have jumped right out of an Indiana Jones movie. Add to that minutes of real-time rendered cutscenes that shape the story and you have one of the best looking console games ever made.\n\nSound\n\n\nKoji Kondo returns to deliver a whole songbook full of marvelous melodies. Some of the eerie dungeon tunes recall the work of minimalist composer Phillip Glass, others are vintage Kondo with sweeping string sounds and melancholic guitar picks. Unfortunately, there are a few stinkers with annoyingly dated synth samples (it's time to update your libraries, Nintendo!) and the legendary Zelda Overworld theme is NOT in the game. Boo! Luckily, there are plenty of returning melodies, such as the Adagio in Kakariko town and familiar ocarina tunes. But what really makes this game are the sound effects. Every location has a multitude of ambient noises, from the clanking of a windmill, the subtle trickling of water to the howling of the wind. The sound effects are brilliant. Depending on what you hit with your sword, you hear a cool metal clank, the bow and arrow are as convincing as the real thing, and the screams of the Dodongo are downright scary. The overworld is alive with bird calls, chirping crickets, animal noises and footsteps. In certain locations, thunder can be heard and it will start to rain -- and here's the kicker: the game is in full surround sound. Zelda is probably the first in-house developed Nintendo title that makes examplary use of the rear audio channel in addition to the L and R stereo channels. The sound virtually engulfs the player, drawing you completely into the world of Hyrule. A world, that players will be so content to live in while the game lasts that we can't put it any other way -- Zelda succeeds on every level.\n\nFlawless victory.\nVerdict\nI have to confess that I'm a long time fan of the Zelda series. Ever since Link to the Past, I have been waiting for another adventure with the same sense of freedom and interactivity. Although games like Final Fantasy, Secret of Mana, and Metroid filled the void, I had to wait six years for Zelda's jump to a next generation console. The wait was very well worth it. Ocarina of Time is easily the best in the series. Sure, the game has a couple of little flaws (the annoying Navi \"hey\" messages, for example) -- but unlike the hundreds and hundreds of uninspired gaming sequels that find their way into console and PC owners' homes every year, Ocarina of Time takes some basic gameplay and story ideas from its predecessors and rolls them into a completely unique experience.\nI don't know how many games I have played in my life where you see some cool scenery in the background and you're thinking \"wow, wouldn't it be great if you could actually go there?\" That's what Zelda is all about. You see something and you're thinking \"wouldn't it be cool if you could...\" -- and you can. The fighting system is fantastic, the new camera system unlike anything you have ever seen. Apart from a little slowdown and a few blurry textures here and there, the graphics are insanely beautiful. The sunsets and rain sequences, the projectile and smoke effects, everything is displayed in vibrant colors and with much attention to detail. Although the lack of the overworld theme is a bummer, the many returning Zelda melodies (such as the glissando announcing a secret or the fanfare when finding an item) and the moody dungeon scores are only outdone by the amazing surround ambient effects.\nIn the gameplay department, the gap between Nintendo's in-house development and third party titles becomes painfully clear. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time should be recommended playing for ever aspiring videogame designer and programmer out there. If you're making games and you haven't played this game, then you're like a director who has never seen Citizen Kane or a musician who has never heard of Mozart. If you're a gamer looking for your next title to buy, then take it from me, this is as good as it's going to get for a looooong time.\nA break-through title from Nintendo that deserves all the hype and praise it's gotten. The limited gold edition is just the icing on the cake. My highest possible recommendation.",

    "title": "Resident Evil 4",
    "review": "Unless you've been hibernating in a PC bunker for the last two years, you've probably played this one already. It hit GameCube in early 2005 and blasted onto the PS2 later that year with a deflated price point and extra content. Now it's 2007, Resident Evil 4 is on PC, it's got all the added goodies of the PS2 and the same addictive gameplay. Unfortunately, Capcom forgot to add mouse support, upgraded textures, any kind of scalable graphics interface, or anything new beyond the PS2 version.\n\nThat being said, RE4 is still a great game. As Leon Kennedy you head to Europe in search of Ashley, the U.S. President's daughter. Craziness ensues as you discover a town of not quite zombified villagers, robed cultists, and all sorts of other monstrosities and curiosities. Resident Evil 4 wowed gamers when it first came out with its willingness to buck many of the stagnant thumbprints of previous Resident Evil games. It introduced a new control scheme to make shooting and maneuvering less of a migraine, put a larger emphasis on action, both in number of opponents and twitch reaction sequences, and told an interesting tale. It still, however, forces you to stop and aim before you shoot, a mechanic that I, personally, still don't understand. It must be written somewhere in the cosmic expanse that \"Thou shalt not make a Resident Evil game where you can shoot from the hip.\" It's a poor mechanic for close-up fighting, and it's still in this one.\n\nMore importantly, RE4 tells an expertly well-paced tale, one of the most attractive aspects of the game. There's rarely a moment during the lengthy run through where you're bored, or you feel like you've completed the challenge ahead a nauseating amount of times before. You will have to retrieve two or three halves of a symbol to open doors on multiple occasions, but the method for acquiring them is always entertaining. Each area feels new, the enemies keep changing forms, weapons, and incessantly surprise you, and your responsibilities switch between protecting your own skin and that of the President's daughter. Wait, escort? Don't vomit just yet; this isn't the kind of escort gameplay you're used to, it's really well done in RE4. The game gives you spots to hide Ashley when you're busy clearing enemies in front, provides an easy to use stay / follow system that doesn't glitch out, and even includes some charming extras, like pressing a button to catch Ashley when she hops from a ledge, or giving her a piggyback boost to open a gate.\n\nHere's the main caveat with the PC version: you can't configure any of the controls to the mouse. If you're without a gamepad, such as an Xbox 360 controller or whatever else, you shouldn't play this game. With no mouse support, you're forced to aim with the keyboard. If you should choose the take such a route, the amount of cursing, self-inflicted injuries, and noise complaints filed by neighbors the ensuing frustration will cause is no fault of ours. We can't quite figure out why Capcom chose not to support the mouse, especially considering Lost Planet, the Xbox 360 original they're bringing over soon, does feature mouse support. They're clearly capable of doing it, they just didn't. Using a gamepad solves the control problem, though the instant action sequences can be disorienting. At various points during the game you'll be prompted to hit two buttons at once to avoid some deadly threat, such as a moving car, swinging blade, or falling axe. Whereas on the GameCube and PS2 these prompts corresponded to the buttons (be it A and B or Circle and Square), the gamepad only shows up as \"1\" or \"2.\" Thankfully the prompts tend to be displayed onscreen in positions corresponding to their layout on the gamepad, but even late in the game it'll still feel awkward.\n\nThe visuals are another area where someone manning this port clearly fell asleep or just didn't care. Character models have been given a significant detail upgrade. They don't look anything as good as with other PC titles with action so up-close, but they're not going to wrinkle your forehead. The backgrounds and cut-scenes, on the other hand, are two very different shades of disappointing. From a distance background visuals look nice, but that's mostly because the level architecture is so well done. Get up close to a brick wall and you'll have to pop some Tums. The lighting is sad compared to other modern PC games, with little to no shadows or attention to realism. Finally, there's simply no excuse for the cut-scenes, which are so horribly compressed it looks as though somebody is dragging a rake across the back of the monitor's screen.\n\nFramerates do remain smooth, however, and there's a lot more to like about the visuals. Enemy designs and animations are fantastic, particularly once you start fighting the painted cultists and giant insects later on. Boss designs can be truly harrowing too, overflowing with gristle, gore, and metallic spikes. Assuming you haven't played this before, some of the boss fights are so unnerving you might even forget about the dungeon wall that looks like construction paper behind them. Amazingly, the game somehow supports a 1920 x 1200 resolution. We can only assume there was some sort of divine intervention to prompt this.\n\nLike in the previous versions, the sound is terrific. In gaming, there's little more satisfying than a booming shotgun blast splattering three heads at once, while other enemies spin and slink to the ground in pain. Thundering weapons effects and eerie enemy howls and chants bring the world of Resident Evil 4 to vibrant life. The voice acting, as seems to be a tradition in the franchise, still sounds forced, like a golf ball through a stirring straw.\n\nYet another element that didn't survive the port in good shape is the UI. It's been included in a horribly low resolution; a pang of visual discomfort you'll be assaulted with every time you open the menu. You'll see it in the bottom right corner of the screen as well, your health ammo display; a constantly visible, blurry circle adding to the sizable portfolio of things done wrong or not at all for the PC version.\nVerdict\nWhile there are a substantial amount of complaints in this review about graphics, the game still plays very well. The puzzle mechanics work smoothly, environments are introduced in skillful fashion, and the fighting is always interesting and low on frustration factor, aside from the aim-to-shoot mechanic in close quarters combat. If you don't have a PS2 or GameCube lying around, you really should play this game, and to do so you really need a gamepad. The game's got five extra missions where you play as Ada Wong, some new weapons and costumes, and a 20 dollar price tag. If you can get past the graphics and input calamities, it's not hard to enjoy.",

    "title": "The Last of Us",
    "review": "The Last of Us is a near-perfect analog for The Road, a literary masterpiece written by Cormac McCarthy. Both present a hopeless, post-apocalyptic situation navigated by two characters – an adult and a child – with nothing but absolute despair surrounding them. Like The Road, The Last of Us is perpetually dangerous and unpredictable, and like The Road, what happened to get society to a point of rapid decay isn’t the focus. It’s the story of the characters at hand, and those characters alone, at the center of both plots. The beauty of The Last of Us when compared to The Road, however, is that it’s fully interactive, complete with all of the vulnerability, uncertainty and perpetual insecurity such a situation inherently provides.\nThe Last of Us seamlessly intertwines satisfying, choice-based gameplay with a stellar narrative. It never slows down, it never lets up, and frankly, it never disappoints. It’s PlayStation 3’s best exclusive, and the entire experience, from start to finish, is remarkable. I lost myself in Naughty Dog’s vision of a pandemic-ridden United States, in the characters that populate this unfortunate wasteland, and in their individual stories. The 17 hours I spent playing through the campaign are among the most memorable I’ve ever spent with a game.\nJOEL REMEMBERS THE WORLD BEFORE THE PANDEMIC.\nPlayers are cast in the role of Joel, a grizzled and tired survivor stuck in a cycle any person could imagine finding oneself in two decades after the collapse of society. He takes odd jobs, acquires food, clothing, and shelter, and repeats the process endlessly, a process that only gets more arduous and desperate as time goes on. Joel does what’s necessary to stay alive, and in the ruined United States he travels around, his survival often means someone else’s untimely death.\n\nOccasionally haunted by his past but living in his dystopian present, Joel is surprisingly easy to root for. In many ways, he’s strangely relatable. He retains shreds of his humanity as best he can, considering the extraordinary circumstances he finds himself in. He has a sharpness to him, but a tenderness, too, which he occasionally displays to his partner, a woman named Tess. In the time it took me to beat The Last of Us, I came to care about Joel, and I became invested in his story, and the stories of those he meets along the way.\n\nThe Last of Us takes place in 2033, so the regular world Joel harkens back to on occasion is one you and I understand. It’s fascinating to think about how he’s evolved since the world crumbled around him, and even if he does what’s necessary to stay alive – including stealing and murdering – it’s hard to fault him for it. In fact, one of the great ironies of The Last of Us is that you’ll be pulling for him no matter how dark things get, or how violent his actions are. He does what’s required. Joel knows it’s either him or them. There’s no gray area. Joel can be cold and ruthless, but those around him have the propensity to be far worse.\nAs riveting as Joel is, he isn’t the only character of consequence in The Last of Us. Indeed, calling him the main character is true only to an extent, because it’s his companion, a young girl named Ellie, who truly steals the show. Joel makes a business arrangement early in the adventure to help transport Ellie across what remains of the United States, a wasteland marked with boundless wildlife alongside cities and towns ruthlessly reclaimed by nature. From there on out, the two are virtually inseparable, even if they are at first skeptical of one another, forced together by circumstances in a world where trust and faith are in extremely short supply.\n\nJoel and Ellie develop a sort of dysfunctional father-daughter relationship as their collective experiences bind them, and rooting for Ellie in particular is commonplace in The Last of Us. Her success means the player is successful, and her hardened exterior is the perfect complement to her complete ignorance of the world before it was destroyed. Ellie was born after the collapse, and as such, she’s full of questions and wonder, often communicated through the many contextual conversations she and Joel share. She’ll pick through records at a music store, become fascinated with wildlife she’s never seen before, and ask a million questions about the past. You watch her learn, grow, and gain meaning. It’s impossible not to become attached to her.\n\nThe interplay between Joel and Ellie, as well as the other characters you meet on your adventure, is one of the great highlights in The Last of Us. Voice acting is not only consistently superb, but the game’s graphical beauty makes the events of The Last of Us overflow with realism. Everything that happens is immediately more memorable, more powerful, and more poignant because your surroundings are so believable. Forests, fields and wooded trails are overgrown, dense, and lush. Abandoned villages and metropolises alike are eerie, silent, and crumbling. Each environment is unique, thoughtfully created, and bursting with little details, including notes, letters, voice recorders and more that tell ancillary stories of survivors you rarely ever meet in person. The game took me so long to beat because I was obsessed with seeing every inch of it. The Last of Us demands exploration, not only to scour for needed supplies, but to satisfy your curiosity.\nJOEL AND ELLIE'S ENDLESS CHATTER IS ONE OF THE LAST OF US' HIGHLIGHTS.\nThe Last of Us is undoubtedly pretty to look at, but that beauty is often overshadowed by imminent peril. Joel and Ellie will confront enemies in all of the various locations they visit, and these battles represent the other side of what makes The Last of Us shine. Combat is tense and nerve-racking. Fighting is as emotionally taxing as it is physically dangerous, because the people Joel fights are, like him, just normal folks trying to survive. In a world where everyone has a singular motivation to keep breathing for one more day, it’s hard to judge even the harshest remnants of humanity you encounter.\n\nStealthily killing entire rooms of enemies is incredibly satisfying, so much so that when you blow your cover, it’s hard not to feel a sense of disappointment (especially when one of your companions occasionally fires a gun or walks in front of an enemy, which you can’t control). Holding down R2 while crouching lets Joel listen carefully to his surroundings, giving him a glimpse of enemy locations in his direct vicinity and an edge in staying away from danger. Some players may consider this a bit cheap, but I’d merely call it gamey. Just like the L3 prompts that tell you where to look and hints that appear if the game determines you’ve been stuck in an area too long (all of which can be turned off), Joel’s listening skill can simply be ignored if you feel like it doesn’t fit. But rest assured, it’s very helpful, especially later in your quest.\n\nThe beauty of stealth in The Last of Us is the incredible, uncomfortable realism you’re forced to witness each and every time you execute a silent kill. Watching a survivor fruitlessly swat at Joel’s arms as he strangles him to death is disturbing, as is quickly shiving a man in his neck and listening to him gurgle some parting breaths as he collapses to the ground. The Last of Us does a phenomenal job of making each and every enemy feel human. Every life taken has weight and each target feels unique and alive. It’s hard not to think about some of the older folks in particular, ones that remember the real world, lived in it, and were once normal. There’s an emotional pang when you’re taking out thugs that look a whole lot like you and your allies.\nOf course, there are enemies that are decidedly inhuman in The Last of Us, too. The collapse of society was instigated by the sudden prevalence of a fungus that wreaks havoc on the human mind, and those humans – known not-so-lovingly as The Infected – are alive, but not well. No matter which faction of humanity a person falls on, whether he’s with the remnants of the federal government, or rogue groups known as Hunters, or even the mysterious resistance organization known as The Fireflies, everyone is united against The Infected. This is simply because The Infected can in turn infect others, further eroding humanity’s already dwindling numbers. They are a perpetual threat to even the slightest hope that humanity can one day step back from the precipice of extinction, and running into them is always frightening.\n\nUnlike your human adversaries, who often work together, audibly communicate, plan their actions, and practice self-preservation, The Infected attack with reckless abandon, with absolutely no regard for their safety and with every intention of killing you. Fighting them is terrifying, especially during your first few encounters, and feels completely different than your engagements with pockets of humanity. The lesser versions of The Infected, colloquially known as Runners, can be taken out with firearms and melee strikes alike, but it’s the Clickers – characters so infected by the Cordyceps fungus that they can’t even see – that will haunt your dreams. They can only be killed with silent shiv strikes or via firearm – silence is more often than not your best weapon against them -- but if they so much as get their hands on you, it’s game over. In this world, they are the true threat. It’s unlikely you’ll ever get comfortable dealing with them, of being mere feet away from them, crouching, hoping they don’t somehow sense you.\n\nAnother brilliant aspect of The Last of Us is its crafting options, all of which happen in real-time. With the exception of actually going to a pause menu, there’s no way to stop the action, so you need to find lulls in order to scavenge for items, put them together and create new goods that can be used both curatively and offensively. The system is extra tense considering you can use, say, alcohol and rags to create either a healing pack or a Molotov Cocktail, but not both with the same goods. Thoroughly exploring environments nets you the components necessary for item creation, giving you yet another reason to inspect surroundings already begging to be rummaged. And item scarcity, a perpetual issue in the world of The Last of Us, means that everything you find is precious in its own way. There aren’t any factories making more of anything you find, and that includes the greatest prize of all: bullets.\nELLIE IS UNDENIABLY THE STAR OF THE SHOW.\nThis perpetuates real consequences based on your decisions. Will you use those scissors and some tape to create a shiv? Or will you attach them to the end of a pole to create a makeshift weapon of war? Will you create a smoke bomb only because you found sugar in the environment and can only carry more if you use what you already have? Or do you bypass the sugar and hope you don’t need it – or what you can make from it – later on? Will you opt for melee strikes to save ammo for another day? Or will you walk in guns-blazing and hope you find shells on the bodies you leave in your wake? How you choose to navigate these forks in the road have considerable effects on how you approach future enemy encounters, adding a special dynamic to The Last of Us not found in very many games.\n\nJoel can also upgrade himself with pills and other supplements hidden throughout the adventure, though here you’ll also have to make careful choices, as there isn’t enough medicine in one playthrough to fully upgrade him. Likewise, all of your weapons, from pistols to shotguns and rifles, can also be upgraded using parts and tools found on your journey. Similarly, you won’t be able to max-out everything, so you’ll need to make thoughtful decisions. This adds an analytical, tactical slant to The Last of Us not found in the likes of Uncharted, though if you really want to upgrade Joel and his goods fully, you could always take advantage of The Last of Us’ very welcome New Game+ feature.\n\nWhile the campaign is absolutely worth playing through multiple times, The Last of Us also comes packing a robust, rich multiplayer mode that isn’t simply a retread of Uncharted’s. In fact, The Last of Us’ multiplayer seems decidedly scaled back in order to fit it into the context of the post-civilization United States, with small player counts and only two modes that pay exceptional detail to the greater context of the single-player campaign.\nThe Last of Us’ online functionality exists within a mode called Factions. Once you begin, you choose one of two sides and then jump into one of two sub-modes: Supply Raid and Survivors. Both are atypical in their approach, especially Survivors, which presents players with a best-of-seven series in a four-on-four match where death is brutally permanent. Survivors forces meticulous play virtually ripped right out of the campaign, except instead of fighting AI-controlled partners, you’ll be dealing with even smarter humans. It’s a truly fun mode, one where every player on the map is overflowing with nerves and afraid to make a mistake.\n\nSupply Raid, on the other hand, is about whittling down your team by eroding their overall life count. It’s more generic than its counterpart, but the idea of having a shared number of lives forces you to strive for better play. It makes you not want to be the reason your team loses, it makes you not want to make silly blunders. Like Survivors, Supply Raid also allows you to craft items on the fly using components found on the map and feels a whole lot like the single-player game. By scaling back the modes and the player counts from the likes of Uncharted, Naughty Dog has removed the tall barrier between single player and multiplayer and has made the two feel interconnected, even ancillarily.\nPLAYING THE LAST OF US ONLINE IS EXCEPTIONALLY FUN.\nWhat’s especially neat about The Last of Us’ online functionality is the metagame that transcends everything you do. When playing online, your character – who is fully customizable in both appearance and loadout – is the leader of a band of survivors. Successfully navigating online matches, collecting items and engaging in one-off challenges called Missions helps grow your band. Of course, if you fail, your band decreases in size. It’s a simple system in premise, but it’s undeniably addicting when you start getting into it. It creates another, higher level, a different way to gauge your overall success by something other than wins or losses and your kill-to-death ratio. Like the single-player campaign, which judges your actions based on future consequences, so too does multiplayer in The Last of Us reward or detract based upon performances that, at the time, may not seem entirely consequential.\n\nThen again, The Last of Us is still all about its single player campaign. Many players will never jump online, and frankly, they won’t be missing out on what truly makes the overall package so incredibly special, so exceptionally noteworthy, such a must-play experience.\nVerdict\nPlayStation 3 isn’t only well-known for its number of exclusive games, but for the sheer number of quality exclusives. That’s what makes The Last of Us even more impressive, because not only does it join the ranks of Uncharted, Killzone, God of War, Infamous and more, but it bests them all. In short, Naughty Dog has crafted a game that impresses in virtually every way. The Last of Us is a true feat. Its unrivaled presentation in particular sets the bar even higher than the Uncharted trilogy already did, and its writing, voice acting and layered gameplay combine to create what is very easily the game to beat for Game of the Year 2013.",

    "title": "Shadow of the Colossus",
    "review": "Shadow of the Colossus is a rather difficult game to review for a couple very important reasons. First, it's hard to talk about the game without spoiling anything, something I'm going to attempt to avoid doing as much as possible. Secondly, trying to describe exactly what makes Shadow of the Colossus so fantastic is akin to trying to describe why the bodies of work of Picasso, Bach or Beethoven are unquestioned classics; you can do your best, but any of these examples must be experienced in full to truly be understood, and especially appreciated.\nWhat isn't difficult, however, is stating that not only is Shadow of the Colossus an absolute must-play experience, but one of the most important games you'll come across anytime soon. Shadow is a true work of art, the likes of which we've only seen approached by a very, very small number of games. The closest thing that comes to mind is ICO, the studio's spiritual precursor to Shadow.\nTHE GRAPHICS IN THE REMASTER LOOK A LOT SHARPER.\nOne thing that Shadow of the Colossus shares with ICO is its sense of solitude, one that overwhelms you with simultaneous feelings of calmness and despair. Whereas most games rely on scattering their environments with living and breathing creatures, intricate structures, various types of foliage and the like to bring their worlds to life, the near-complete lack of any of these in the world of Shadow of the Colossus forces you to essentially paint your own picture of how the world came to be as it is, why it is essentially a wasteland, or even a prison if you will, for the colossi that inhabit said land.\nIn this, Shadow excels more so than possibly any title in the history of gaming. No game has done so much with so little, and no game has focused so much of its design and gambled so much of its experience on what essentially comes down to sixteen boss battles, the traveling to them between each fight and very little else.\nBut even with as simple a setup as this sounds, Shadow of the Colossus is an experience that is not to be missed. Shadow practically redefines the term \"cinematic\" in videogames, especially the sort where the player is in control during the entirety of the game.\nAt Whatever the Cost\nYou begin the game with very little setup. You're seen traveling across the game's exterior world before arriving upon an enclosed wasteland, setting forth within its central castle - one of the game's few man-made interior environments - and placing a clearly deceased girl upon a pedestal. You're then given a voiceover that explains that the land you're in is a cursed one, forbidden for any living creature to enter. But, great power also lies within this land, including the power to restore life to the dead.\nYou're then given the ominous task to defeat each of the sixteen colossi that roam the land, after which your female companion may or may not actually be brought back to life - don't worry, this isn't a spoiler; you're told this at the outset. You're told that it \"may not be impossible\" for her to come back, and you're sent on your way. The setup is pretty cool in that you're told that things may not end up exactly as planned and that your loved one may or may not come back to life, giving you doubt as to whether the massive task you're about to set out on is worth it or not. Doubt apparently matters not though, as you're determined to do whatever it takes to bring her back, which helps install an even greater sense of purpose for your actions as the player. You want to bring her back to life not only to complete the game, but to figure out who she is, why she had her life taken from her, and why she's so very important to you.\nFrom the start of the game, you're armed with your sword, a bow, your horse and the clothes on your back. As your sword is said to be the only thing in the world that is capable of taking down the colossi you're after, it's pretty evident from the get-go that your small inventory is all you'll ever need and likely ever have access to throughout the game. The game instills a great \"do with what you've got\" attitude, and as such rewards you with a greater sense of accomplishment as you never really receive any extraneous help from the game via new items or the like. It's simply you, the colossi and the world around you.\nColossal Battles\nAs mentioned at the beginning of the review, it's hard to discuss many things that make Shadow of the Colossus great because most of said examples have to do with the various colossi themselves. You've likely seen - and via the demo, possibly beaten - the first colossus in the game. While he's pretty damn cool, he serves only as a very tiny appetizer for what the rest of the game has to offer.\nWhile you'll have your favorites (mine are numbers seven and fifteen, while our Guides guru, Mark Ryan Sallee's, is number thirteen), there's little question that the game gets better and better as a whole as it progresses. Shadow of the Colossus constantly outdoes itself the whole way through. While one fight may make you wonder how things could get any cooler, the very next one will answer that question and turn things up a couple notches. By the time you reach the end of the game, you'll begin watching other people who have just started the game and shake your head, saying, \"If you think that's cool, just wait.\" The torture, though, is not being able to say anything more than that because anything else would ruin what is easily one of the most wondrous, rewarding and constantly wowing adventures you'll experience anywhere.\nThe first few colossi you'll fight are rather straightforward to beat; find some fur to dangle from, climb to their weak spot and stab away while you try and avoid being thrown from their convulsing and twitching masses. As you progress through the game though, the puzzle aspect of the game kicks into full gear and you'll first need to figure out how to even get onto each colossus, much less figure out where you need to begin impaling your sword into its vital spots. This part of the game is half the fun. Some of the monstrous beasts you'll encounter will require that you sprint full-speed on your horse alongside it and make a daring jump just to latch on. Others will be the opposite, where you'll have to ride for your life and wait for the opportune moment in order to strike. This brings us to a quick aside: your horse, Agro, who is also your only companion throughout the game, is nearly flawless in every aspect of his implementation. Firstly, his animation is absolutely phenomenal and easily one of the most realistically animated animals we've ever seen in a videogame. Secondly, he does a great job (for the most part) of finding his own path through an area. There are a couple small wooded areas in the game that he has problems with, running into trees and such if you're not careful to direct him around them, but he does an excellent job of navigating down winding paths on his own. Aside from having occasional problems with trees, his movement, reactions and general demeanor give him enough personality that, even though he doesn't talk, he becomes a great compatriot and even friend throughout your time through the game.\nBack to the colossi, the tactics that you'll need to use to defeat each of them are unique in and of themselves, separating each battle into its own individualized and standout section of the game. The end goal is always the same in that you'll need to find and stab each colossus in its vital area(s), but the fun is in getting there and hanging on, not to mention the sheer beauty in witnessing all of this. Just to mix things up, the game throws you a fair bit of curveballs that challenge what you think you know. Just when you think that every colossus' weak spot is on their head or at the highest point, you'll find out that this isn't the case. When you think that each and every colossus will get larger and larger and put the focus on simply climbing them, once again, you'll find out that this isn't the case. When you're used to using the environment to your advantage to defeat the colossi, things will all of a sudden become turned around and the environment will work against you and the colossus with it. And when you think you've seen everything there is to see, you'll quickly realize you haven't seen anything yet. When you've finally beaten all of the colossi, you'll be treated to an absolutely fantastic finale. Without spoiling anything, I must say that Shadow of the Colossus has one of the best ending sequences I've ever witnessed.\nThe events that take place, what you'll see and, as general of a descriptor as this is it's absolutely true, what you'll experience is nothing short of phenomenal. When It's Over, It's Not Over But even when you're kicked back to the title screen, your journey is not over. Shadow has a whole boatload of things to do, collect and so forth after you've finished it off, including a hard mode, and you'll be immediately sucked back in. As you beat each colossus your strength will increase, and your accrued strength from the first time through will stick with you at the start of the second, allowing you to reach places you couldn't the first time around. In order to hunt down everything there is to find in the seemingly barren world, you'll actually need to finish the game more than once. And while you're working through the main story for the second or third time, by adventuring and completing other tasks you'll find a whole ton of other goodies to collect. So, while you might think you've seen everything there is to be seen after your first time through the game, think again. If you want a hint of what's in store for you, check out our forthcoming guide.\nA Visual and Aural Masterpiece While we generally say that graphics aren't important with regards to a game's overall enjoyment, Shadow of the Colossus proves that while we might be right about the technical side of that, pixel-perfect art direction can heighten an experience in ways that next-gen systems can only dream of. Shadow of the Colossus is a visual masterpiece in this regard. It doesn't have the best framerate we've ever seen - though it never actually hinders gameplay in any way - and the game's geometric detail isn't as high as some other lookers on the system, but its art direction is matched only by a very, very small number of games. The colossi themselves look stunning, both in terms of size and in terms of their design, with semblances of animals, machinery and god-like icons all mixed into one. Fur covers large areas of their bodies and rivals similar animalistic attempts on the Xbox. Their animation is phenomenal as it perfectly communicates not only the size but the weight of these creatures as well.\nThe landscape is also breathtaking. Though much of the land you're in is made up of some sort of nearly-barren wasteland, be it rock, sand or simply dried earth, you'll also come across smaller segments of living and thriving plant life, like dense woods for example, giant waterfalls and more. It all blends together in such a natural manner that you'll never notice when you actually cross over from one terrain type to another, further implying that this land was once full of life but has now mostly become a desolate wasteland, with only pockets of life left in it. Sound effects don't really make up much of the game's audio track, though what's there - like Agro's hoofs beating against the lay of the land or your feet scrambling over segments of rock - all sound great.\nThe game's soundtrack is absolutely stellar, with passages that remind of us tunes that we usually only associate with epic movies or RPGs. The soundtrack perfectly matches with the tone of each battle, with the first being somewhat upbeat as you can basically have your way with the first colossus, while the last is something much more downtrodden and somber in tone, with each track in-between blending the ends together in a very natural manner. Will Everyone Appreciate It? Shadow of the Colossus is one of those rare games that most everyone can appreciate in some fashion, but may not quite be everyone's cup of tea in the end. It's not as action-oriented as something like God of War, though it's easily its equal in terms of presentation and art direction. And while Shadow may not have the namesake or be as directly relatable as a Grand Theft Auto title, it easily trumps them in terms of the emotional experiences you'll take from it. Really, if you look at it from a very fact-based standpoint then the game doesn't break down into much more than climbing a giant creature and stabbing it repeatedly until it's dead.\nBut when you stand back and take in the game as a whole, it excels in virtually every way possible. It's not that Shadow of the Colossus isn't something that any gamer who is interested in it will enjoy, because they will, and thoroughly so, but it might not be one of those titles you can pass off to your ADD-suffering little cousin. But not every game is made for the Ritalin generation, Shadow of the Colossus being one of them. In fact, it's a game that rewards you for taking a chance and seeking out new experiences, and in these ways and what it'll give back to you for doing so, it's a phenomenal success.\nVerdict\nShadow of the Colossus is easily one of my favorite games on the PlayStation 2 and ranks highly among my favorites on any system. It is a true masterpiece in terms of art direction and, dare I say, cinematography. From the fights with the colossi to exploring the world to basically just standing back and letting it all soak in, Shadow of the Colossus is an amazing experience and an absolute must-have title.",

    "title": "Mass Effect 2",
    "review": "Every generation of game consoles has its defining titles. When one thinks back on a system and its legacy, an association with those games is often made. For instance the NES and SNES eras gave us Super Mario Bros. and Zelda, while the original PlayStation served up Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy VII. Naturally, this generation isn't without its own defining set of games, too, and one of those titles is undoubtedly Mass Effect 2, a project from the minds at Canadian developer BioWare.\nIf you only pay attention to the PlayStation 3 scene, you might be confused as to when the original Mass Effect came out and why you never heard about it or played it. Unfortunately, 2007's Mass Effect never made it to the PS3. The series' first entry came only to Xbox360 and PC, and due to Microsoft having published the game, PS3 owners will never see it on their native console. Mass Effect 2, however, is another story entirely.\nSHEPARD WORKING OVER A YMIR MECH.\nIt's perfectly natural for gamers to be wary of jumping into the Mass Effect series with the second game, but BioWare has delivered a compelling package that does its best to quell any uncertainty with skipping the first title. It's worth noting that the original Mass Effect is a different game in many respects from Mass Effect 2, so in terms of gameplay, you're getting the better experience right off the bat. And while Mass Effect 2 is certainly a story-driven affair related directly to the original title, you'll have access to an in-game comic book feature that explains the story of the first game and lets you make choices that will affect your playthrough of the sequel. Combine that with the fact that Mass Effect 2 on PS3 has a slew of DLC extras and even an upgraded game engine, and you'll be struck by the obvious: Mass Effect 2 on the PlayStation 3 is the best, most complete version of the game available. Sorry, Xbox 360 version. You were good. But this is better.\nYour Guide to the Galaxy Mass Effect 2 walkthrough Side quests info and help Learn to romance\nSend us your tips » Tweet us your tips »\nMass Effect 2 is the product of artfully mixing certain genres. On one hand, it's a third-person shooter. On the other hand, it's an RPG with sandbox, open-world sensibilities. BioWare has brilliantly blended together these genres and influences to craft an experience that's not only much better than the admittedly-fantastic original Mass Effect, but also better than virtually all of the like-minded games on the market today. It provides a more streamlined experience than the original, with more focus on character development and action and less on some of the minutiae that bogged down the series' first outing.\nThe Mass Effect series introduces gamers to an alternate form of our galaxy where humanity has found alien life. Using a special device orbiting Pluto called a Mass Relay, humanity jettisons to the far edges of the galaxy only to run into a bunch of other species that have known about each other for some time. No one really trusts the humans (the new kids on the block) and our species is left struggling both for galactic trust and identity in the face of a brand-new existential threat. That's where you come in.\nMass Effect 2 begins under dire circumstances. You'll immediately witness the abrupt and violent death of the main character named Commander Shepard, only to find him or her resurrected by a rich, xenophobic human-first group called Cerberus. There's a reason Cerberus used its unlimited resources to revive Shepard, however, and it has to do with stopping the threat posed by the Collectors, a nebulous species that targets human space colonies. As this threat grows, so too does Cerberus' resolve to stop them, and they'll use Shepard and his or her team of assembled bad-asses to get things done.\n\nBut Shepard isn't a static character. The beauty of Mass Effect 2 is that it is what you make it. While Mass Effect 2 certainly has a string of events that ultimately lead from point A to point Z, getting to and through all of the points in between opens up a staggering amount of choices, paths and outcomes. All of this is centered around the Paragon/Renegade choice system, where Shepard can make kind, understanding and righteous decisions (Paragon) or harsh, to-the-point and uncompassionate decisions (Renegade). But it's the gray in between that's truly riveting, and this particular aspect of the game will no doubt floor players. Everything you say, everything you do, and everything you decide upon has lasting, real consequences in the game -- both for the better and the worse. And be mindful, because those choices will one day affect your playthrough of Mass Effect 3, too.\nApart from its story-driven nature and RPG influences, Mass Effect 2 is a third-person action game at its core, and the gameplay is fluid and well-executed. Under most circumstances, you'll get to bring two party members of your choice along with you. The computer will largely control these two characters, though you can use various weapon and skill wheels to offer up commands for those characters during the heat of battle. This is, of course, in addition to controlling Shepard himself (or herself), which will require you to quickly become comfortable with your particular character's strengths and weaknesses. Mass Effect 2 relies on character classes, so if you're playing as a Soldier, you better get used to using a wide variety of weapons. On the other hand, Vanguards and Sentinels will be relying far more on Biotics and Tech than conventional firearms.\nMuch of the game revolves around recruiting your team members from various corners of the galaxy, and each member of your team plays an important role in ultimately working to stop the Collectors. Better yet, the aforementioned Paragon and Renegade slants you can take through the game will help you nurture or maim your relationships with each person. Treat the characters well, tend to them, listen to their ramblings, and even complete character-specific quests for them, and they'll become loyal. Ignore them, treat them badly, and use them solely as battle fodder, and they may not like you so much. Relationships can even become romantic under certain circumstances, so you can try to cultivate something more than friendship if you so desire.\nWEAK FODDER FOR YOUR RIFLE.\nWith the combat, characters, setting and story so solid, you would think you wouldn't need anything else. But there's more. Mass Effect nerds know full-well that one of the most enjoyable aspects of the game is the insane amount of detail put into everything. So while combat and conversation may wear you out from time to time, that won't stop you from going to planets and mining for minerals that will allow you to upgrade your ship, your weapons, and your armor. This also won't stop you from completing one of the game's many side quests or reading the insanely-detailed codex and planet entries.\nMass Effect 2 is a game with a staggering amount of high quality content. And better yet, it's all painted over with a slick coat of awesome.\nVerdict\nMass Effect 2 is one of the best games on PlayStation 3 and a must-own. It has a deep, fleshed-out story and focuses intensely on character development, which will appeal to RPG fans. Its non-linear approach, choice making and reliance on gray areas gives advocates of the sandbox-style game a reason to delve in. Its solid third-person shooting combat isn’t only functional, but stronger than many dedicated third-person shooters and a reason for shooter and action fans to get in on the fun. And above all else, the game’s clean look, amazing voice acting, stellar story and interesting characters will push you to go further and further into Mass Effect 2 to see everything it has to offer.\nAt the end of the day, Mass Effect 2 essentially does everything it does exceptionally well, and it shows from beginning to end. PlayStation 3 gamers had to wait a year to get their hands on Mass Effect 2, but the wait was well worth it. Not only do you have a game that’s already running on the engine for the upcoming Mass Effect 3, but you have a game packed with DLC and access to an in-game comic book that explains the game’s story to those new to Mass Effect. But don’t remain new to Mass Effect for long. Mass Effect 2 is a game that you should purchase, play, and enjoy. And you should do so as soon as time allows.",

    "title": "Super Metroid",
    "review": "The last Metroid is in captivity. The galaxy is at peace. Samus Aran, having successfully completed her latest mission, sets off to find a new bounty to hunt – but she doesn't get far. A distress call, an exploration of an abandoned research facility and an encounter with an old and unexpected enemy draw her back into the saga of the Metroids, and back to the site of her first ever encounter with them. Super Metroid is the third installment of the Metroid series, a legendary SNES action/adventure title that puts players once again into the role of bounty hunter Samus Aran, and once again into the mazelike corridors of Planet Zebes – but it feels like it's for the first time. The original Metroid established the setting and feel. Metroid II, from the Game Boy, elaborated on the story. But it was this game, Super Metroid, that pulled together all of the series' previously established elements, embellished them, and polished the experience of exploration, retraversal and power-up acquisition into a true masterpiece of game design. Super Metroid is not to be missed. After playing through the game's prologue battle and flight from a self-destructing space station, you'll find yourself landing in the rain on the surface of Zebes. And you're alone. There are no enemies. It's just you, your ship, and a vacant set of rooms and shafts. Soon enough, of course, Zebes comes to life with alien foes, traps and interactive environments – but the scene has been set. You're isolated in this world, with no outside assistance, and no help but what you find hidden in the halls.\nSamus' exploration begins with revisiting abandoned areas at first familiar from the original NES adventure, like the site of her final battle with Mother Brain and the corridor where she first claimed the Morph Ball. And it's there again – the first power-up in a chain of collectibles you'll acquire, each of which opens more and more area to explore, and each of which gives Samus some new ability. It's the design formula that Super Metroid perfected, and so many other games have since copied – giving you a fully interconnected, explorable world to experience, but letting you only access it a bit at a time. Getting the Morph Ball lets you fit Samus through tight spaces in the form of a rolled-up ball. Then getting the Missiles allows you to open red doors. Then getting the Ice Beam lets you freeze foes and use them as platforms ... but the first Metroid did all that before. What sets Super apart is that, after introducing all the established staples, it just keeps going. You'll further collect Super-powered missiles and megaton-exploding Power Bombs, the velocity-fueling Speed Booster, the Mega Man-esque Charge Beam and more – by the end of the adventure, Samus' Power Suit will be overflowing with upgrades and new armaments, and that's a great boost to the satisfaction factor of the Metroid experience. At the time of Super Metroid's release, the majority of video games still offered heroes whose powers were set in Stage 1 and didn't change all the way through the ending credits. That you get to slowly build up Aran's abilities over time, here, makes you feel much more engaged. And, even better, you don't have to. There are six different regions of Zebes to discover, most of them requiring you to collect some new beam or method of mobility to access – but many of Samus' power-ups are optional. Super Metroid's enjoyed over 13 years of replayability now because you can challenge yourself to try to complete the game without collecting all of the optional upgrades, or to complete the game as quickly as possible, or both at the same time. The gaming sub-culture of speedrunning was birthed around Super Metroid's flexible design that allowed players to create their own unique routes through the game, exploiting secret passages and their own battle-hardened skills to find the fastest path of blasting through Brinstar, Norfair, Maridia and the Wrecked Ship. It's still a blast to try to beat your own personal best time. Playing Super Metroid as a Virtual Console title makes the experience even more smooth than ever before, as the addition of the VC save state feature can help you keep your time down – no more running to an out-of-the-way save room when the real world calls you away from your game. And, played with the Wii Classic Controller, the game feels like a perfect fit – but both Classic and Cube pads work well, thanks to the foresight of Nintendo's developers in the early '90s, who included a custom button configuration menu screen that will allow you to reassign Samus' shooting, jumping and dashing to whichever pattern of triggers you'd personally prefer.\nVerdict\nIt took Nintendo a while, but Samus finally arrived on the SNES in 1994, almost three years after the 16-bit system debuted. And, again, it's taken Nintendo a while – but Samus has finally arrived here, on the Virtual Console, after nine months since the Wii's launch. On both occasions, Super Metroid's been worth the wait. There's just no beating this game's classic appeal. It's a blast to play, it's perfectly designed, and it's home to such replayability that even now dedicated fans are still trying to beat their best times of completion. Not many games can work on so many levels simultaneously – existing both as an intense, moody adventure of trepidatious exploration into an isolated alien world, but also being one of the best run-and-gun as fast as you can action experiences ever made. If you've never played Super Metroid, you owe it to yourself as a gamer to finally find out about what you've been missing all these years. And if you have played Super Metroid, you've probably already taken the 800 Wii Point plunge and downloaded it to your channel array, where it deserves nothing less than a spot of honored prestige on Screen 1. Maybe right next to that Mii Channel.",

    "title": "Bioshock",
    "review": "Last year, 2K Games released a dark and compelling tale for Xbox 360 and PC owners that was set beneath the sea in the halls of an underwater city known as Rapture. Initially a utopian experiment for artists and scientists, the machinations of Rapture's citizens twisted the city into a nightmarish state -- one that you unfortunately find yourself trapped in. For a while, it appeared that the first-person shooter wouldn't ever see the light of day on the PS3, but, thankfully, 2K Games took an extra year to bring the critically-acclaimed game to Sony's system. Much more than a basic port, 2K included some exclusive extras for the PS3 as a incentive for users that have had to wait to explore Rapture's halls. Is this the definitive \"Director's Cut\" of BioShock? The answer below may surprise you.\n\nBy now, many people know the premise behind BioShock, if not the entire story. For those of you who have managed to go into a total media blackout for the past year, allow me to provide an abridged summary of the main plot points. Set in 1960, your character is a young man who finds himself stuck in a rather precarious situation when the plane he's travelling on crashes into the ocean.\n\nEscaping the wreckage of the plane, he manages to seek refuge in Rapture, a massive underwater city designed to free people from the relative constraints of society, religion and other restrictive organized bodies to fulfill their potential. This vision was created by a man known as Andrew Ryan, a man whose motives were pure, but whose implementation ultimately failed horrifically. As you move through Rapture, hoping to uncover the secrets of why the city is falling apart, you'll be forced to fight for survival against the remaining survivors. While I could go on and on about the story and some of its themes of genetic and personal manipulation (which makes for one of the most compelling games in recent history), I'd rather point you towards Charles's review from last year, which sums up the elements of the gameplay beautifully.\n\n\nWatch IGN's video review here.\n\nFor the most part, BioShock on the PS3 is exactly the same as the PC and 360 versions of the game. However, I thought that I'd highlight some of the differences that PS3 owners will experience with this version. First off the bat is the mandatory ten minute install process, during which you'll be treated to the old standard, \"You're Getting to Be a Habit with Me,\" which is a rather ironic inclusion considering all of the plasmid and genetic manipulation that runs rampant within Rapture. The decision to acknowledge the addiction to these items by the denizens (and by extension, yourself) is quite a humorous one and worthy of note, especially if you wind up returning to replay the game over and over on various difficulty settings.\n\nSpeaking of difficulty settings, the PS3 version of BioShock receives an exclusive mode known as Survivor, whose subtitle, \"Every Bullet Counts,\" is an indication of how the game is structured -- and it's not simply a battle limitation, either. Unlike the other three difficulty modes, Survivor radically confines the bullets and items that you receive over the course of the entire adventure, and while you can switch to another mode if it's too hard, is designed to be challenging. If you pick up a gun, you may find only one round left in it. Plus, health items and Eve hypos don't restore as much of your meters as they would on a lower difficulty level, which forces you to ration your supplies to ensure that you can make it through battles.\n\nThis is especially true because your cash flow is just as restricted -- when you pick up money from a fallen splicer or a cracked safe, you may only get two or three dollars instead of twenty or thirty. That means that having accuracy with every single shot is important, because you won't always be able to find extra rounds or have the money to purchase bullets at vending machines, especially if you need first aid kits to heal yourself. What's more, the splicers and other enemies that you'll face off against are tougher and much smarter than ever before. Each one will take multiple shots from a wrench or a gun without going down, and they'll frequently seek out cover and fire behind it or hover near a first aid station to immediately heal themselves when they're in danger. Big Daddies, for instance, are truly brutal and shrug off loads of damage before they die.\n\nSHE NEEDS AN OLD PRIEST AND A YOUNG PRIEST...\n\nAs a result, you may find yourself using many more of the status-affecting Plasmids that have cheaper Eve costs than ever before as you try to make your way through this mode. For instance, using Target Dummy to draw enemies into pools of water before electrifying a group of splicers, or using Enrage to force enemies to pick each other apart before you move in and mop up the remaining group is an extremely useful tactic. However, just be aware that having this sneakier stance can potentially overcome the \"Every Bullet Counts\" limitation for the mode; by using powers like Security Bullseye and Telekinesis to save my ammunition, I was able to frequently max out my ammunition supply, as well as collect more than enough cash to purchase items throughout this difficulty mode.\n\nIt doesn't ruin the mode or the challenge posed by the splicers or Big Daddies by any stretch of the imagination, especially if you're experienced with first-person shooters, but it's a minor thing to keep in the back of your head. However, even with this small caveat, Survivor mode highlights just how flexible and deep the Plasmid system and -- by extension -- the combat of BioShock is, because you can move through the game like a traditional shooter or approach it with a stealthier, more cautious stance.\n\n\n\nOn top of Survivor mode and full trophy support, a few adjustments have been made to some of the basic gameplay mechanics. For one thing, the hacking mini-game, which you'll use to convert cameras, security bots and turrets over to your side to use against your enemies, is much easier to perform on the PS3. The 360's directional pad was too imprecise to move between the circuits easily, but thanks to the DualShock's D-pad, you can fly through each box and complete your hacks quickly. What's more, the newly downloadable plasmids that were released a few months after the game was released are included within all four difficulty levels of the game, and are easily found. For instance, Sonic Boom, the offensive plasmid that pushes enemies backwards, is immediately accessible at the Gatherer's Garden in Fontaine's Fishery.\n\nEven with these features included, there's one that isn't accessible at this point in time: The PS3 version will be getting exclusive content in the form of downloadable Challenge Rooms, which will present the realm of Rapture in a completely new way, with puzzles, situations and other instances that players will be able to solve. Essentially side stories or alternate history brainteasers, the Challenge Rooms could potentially extend the life of the game substantially. However, none of these rooms are currently available and probably won't be available at launch; we haven't heard anything about when they'll be accessible of if you'll need to pay for them either. As a result, this feature is essentially useless until they're finally released at some point in the future. I wish that I had a chance to check these out beforehand. While it's not something that ruins the BioShock experience by any means, PS3 owners should be aware that they won't be able to fully experience all of the content for a while.\n\nBUGS BUNNY TOOK HALLOWEEN A BIT TOO FAR THIS YEAR.\n\nHowever, what does detract from the gameplay is the fact that there are a number of technical issues that should have been ironed out in the extra year of development time that the PS3 version has had. For one thing, the slowdown that cropped up in the 360 version of the game is still present within the PS3 version, and is inexcusable in just how frequent it occurs. It's strange when you're facing off against one particular splicer and the game's framerate stutters, but when you get into an area with a Big Daddy and a few Nitro Splicers, the slowdown can hitch the game for three or more seconds thanks to the explosions and actions of each creature. That's just horrible, and should've been fixed instead of ported over.\n\nSimilarly, object detection issues remain, as you'll find Pep Bars, bags of chips and other items sticking through desks and into drawers, or halfway in and out of crates or other containers. Even stranger is the fact that you'll find some firearms dropped from killed enemies that you can plainly see but not pick up the guns to collect their bullets. While the amount of bodies that twitch after an enemy has been killed has been dramatically reduced, you'll still run into a couple of enemies that will vibrate and shake with post-mortem seizures.\n\nWhat's more, the Little Sister glitch returns with the PS3 version. This isn't nearly as bad as the other problems that I just mentioned, particularly because you can gain extra Adam to purchase extra plasmids in the game, but it does stand out as a glitch nestled in a load of technical problems from last year's experience. Were this to be considered the definitive BioShock experience, you'd think that many of these bugs would've been fixed, or at least explainable as to why they're still in the game. As they currently exist, they seem to be more like a carryover from a bad port of the title.\n\nAN ICE FACIAL WILL DEFINITELY CLEAR UP THAT SKIN CONDITION.\n\nThis can also be said about some of the visuals within the game, which have received a number of enhancements, but also suffer from older, less impressive texture work. 2K Games went out of their way to make sure that the larger capacity of the Blu-ray was used to implement higher resolution textures across the title, as well as improve some of the in-game cutscenes. For the most part, you'll see these appear as a slightly sharper Rapture across the board, and you'll be able to pick up some features that look better than on the 360, such as pools of water or neon signage. However, there does appear to be a strange mix of the older textures scattered in the title as well, so you'll find quite a lot of texture pop in that will occur as you move through levels. This isn't solely as you load up a new level; this can occur even as you move through a section. It doesn't ruin the game's beauty in the slightest, but it does stick out like a sore thumb at times.\nVerdict\nIf you never experienced the halls of Rapture and have been waiting for its appearance on the PS3, there really is no discussion to be had. Go out and get your hands on BioShock -- you will thoroughly enjoy exploring the incredible story and the excellent action that the game is known for. However, if you've played the game before, or are expecting this to be the definitive version, that's can't be found here. Sure, the full trophy support and Survivor mode are great, and the Challenge Rooms could add a ton to the replayability (whenever it's implemented). However, old glitches that should've been fixed in the PS3 development hold this version back from being completely realized.",

    "title": "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim",
    "review": "I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made.\nPart of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds – the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user – but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready.\nIt contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge.\nMany times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward.\nKilling a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words – each Shout has three – hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim.\nNot only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding.\nSkyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.\nYou can speed by all this if you want. You can drive directly through the main story content, see the conclusion and bail out, having never increased a skill category to 100 or read a virtual copy of The Antecedents of Dwemer Law. But to do so is to defeat the purpose of playing The Elder Scrolls. This is a world that rewards the obsessive and the adventurous, one where creative quest designs are the standard across primary and secondary storylines, not the exception. Primary quest lines may proceed in predictable fashion for a while, but only to lull you into a sense of complacency before the inevitable betrayal sends you scrambling in unexpected directions. The rewards are just as exciting, offering all sorts of unique gear and significant bonuses for dealing with the Thieves Guild, entering into the ranks of the magical College of Winterhold, or joining the battle-hardened Companions in Whiterun. These are the strongest storylines in the game, but even the shorter quests sprinkled all over Skyrim impress.\nRandom NPCs will run up to deliver notes in the middle of the wilderness, others whisper rumors in inns. Blacking out after randomly entering into a drinking contest, luring innocents to their deaths at demonic shrines or complying with the demands of a cannibal haunting a morgue are only some of the peculiar events you may encounter in Skyrim's non-essential content. You may see all of this, or after an extensive playthrough miss the quests entirely. Bethesda Game Studios' achievement isn't simply that there's well over one hundred hours of content in Skyrim, but that the content so frequently defies expectations. To have such an immense game where so little feels like a grind is incredibly rare, and a significant part of what makes this one of the best role-playing games ever created.\nFor such a complex game, Skyrim is surprisingly user-friendly. The Elder Scrolls' traditional leveling mechanics still apply. When you turn in a quest or kill a character, you don't receive experience points. Instead, skills level up through use. Cast fireballs and frost spells and your Destruction skill will go up. Craft armor pieces and your Smithing will increase, brew potions and your Alchemy will shoot up, and deflect damage with a shield to increase Block. After enough of these categories have increased, your overall character level notches up, allowing either Magicka, Health or Stamina to be increased. This is how you define your class, piece by piece, favoring Magicka if you want to use spells, Health and Stamina if you prefer weapons, or a combination if you don't want to specialize. It's an easy to use, sensible system, and the results are easy to see, a welcome change from the attribute system of old, which in retrospect seems cumbersome.\nInfluences from Bethesda's work with Fallout 3 can be seen as well, as each skill category is associated with a perk tree filled with unlockable powerful bonuses. One perk point is assigned every time your overall character level increases, but you don't have to spend it immediately. Points can be stored until you're absolutely sure about the best bonuses to unlock, which could be anything from a chance to decapitate enemies with a one-handed weapon swing, to a zoom ability while using the bow and arrow. With significant bonuses embedded into every perk tree, unlocking new abilities is always an exciting process, often resulting in tough decisions as you choose between unlocking dual-casting for your Restoration spells or learning how to create Dwarven armor, offering loads of incentive to replay the game with a different character build.\nThe Fallout influence can also be seen in the weapon combat system. By swatting at enemies with maces, axes and swords you trigger slow-motion death animations in the style of Fallout 3's glorified fatalities. It's a decent way to add a little flair to The Elder Scrolls' traditionally flat, floaty combat. Fighting with sword and shield feels more exciting in Skyrim than it's ever been, but it's still inconsistent. Many times it feels like you're slicing air instead of a mythical creature's flesh, though there's a certain adrenaline rush appeal to charging into a fight in a first-person perspective against a towering Dwemer centurion, mammoth or giant that fills your entire field of vision. Useful perks like a slow motion effect that triggers every time you block during an enemy's power attack gives depth to the close-range fighting, so while the system may be simple at first, it improves if you're willing to invest.\nThe spell system has received BioShock-like adjustments. When playing in first-person mode your hands hover at the sides of the screen with magic active. When you finally snap out of the mesmerized stupor brought on by gazing into the rotating blue cubes that characterize Alteration magic, you can cast from both hands. One hand can blast fire while the other shoots electricity. One can channel a heal while the other shoots a jet of frost at an advancing enemy. You can conjure a spectral sword and use the free hand to set fiery runes along the ground that explode when any hostiles step over. If you've unlocked the proper perks, it's even possible to combine the same spell into a more powerful version, letting you cast fireballs Street Fighter-style for better results. The system makes playing a pure caster the most fun it's ever been in The Elder Scrolls, and opens up useful hybrid options, letting you swing an axe while actively channeling a fire spell or healing effect. With a greatly improved visual presentation and the always entertaining physics system that takes hold after a target dies, tossing magic in The Elder Scrolls has never felt this satisfying, as a well-placed fireball can send a charging bear tumbling helplessly down the slope of a stony mountain.\nYou don't have to be alone during combat, either. You can summon magical creatures or hire NPCs to tag along. Followers exist all over Skyrim, and if you do them favors, they'll be willing to venture outside towns and deal extra damage during a fight. Followers can even be given simple movement and interaction commands or saddled with extra gear, though don't expect to interact with them to the degree that you can with party members in BioWare games. The followers are meant to be tools of battle instead of ever-evolving personalities, but some still stand out, such as a boundlessly self-confident Khajiit in Winterhold's College, or, if you're into Conjuration magic, a summoned demon warrior that can't help but insult any hostile that walks into range.\nAs more enemies join a fight, things do occasionally get awkward. During large scale battles, pathing around Skyrim's environments can be problematic, as summoned creatures and followers get stuck on pieces of geometry. The drama of climactic moments, like when the screen is cluttered with soldiers as you overtake forts in the civil war quest line, tends to occasionally be undercut by the erratic movement patterns of enemies as they run around like over-caffeinated toddlers. Even during less hectic interactions such as conversations, problems exist. At times characters won't be in the right positions after you say hello, so you'll wind up talking to a wall or watching as an NPC inexorably slides down a staircase while delivering lines of dialogue. At least the conversation interface is a big improvement from Oblivion, where time flows naturally while characters talk instead of mysteriously freezing, and the voice acting is of a generally higher quality as well, though still sounds forced in some cases.\nThe visuals have also been dramatically improved over the last Elder Scrolls game. The sense of adventure and discovery is strong enough in Skyrim given how many cool items and quests there are to find, but the addition of beautiful scenery makes the inclination to obsessively scour Skyrim's landscapes irresistible. Mountains shrouded in mist ring every tract of open field, forest and marsh, and if you're willing to walk, you can eventually climb their slopes and view the rest of the world from above. Waterfalls tumble from high cliffs and split off into smaller tributaries as they wind through the rocks below, flowing across terrain that feels realistically varied. You'll see foggy mornings and crystal clear days, take in polychromatic aurorae streaked ribbon-like across night skies, rainstorms and near blinding blizzards, making it easy to drop what you're doing and survey a scene just to appreciate its beauty.\nWeapon and armor designs are fantastically detailed, to the point where the increased damage or armor bonus for a new piece of gear is usually less exciting than the opportunity to marvel at its design. Playing in first-person gives you a close up of the weapons, like the curvilinear patterns built into steel war axes or the spiny surface of a demonic mace pulsing with glowing-green glyphs. Bethesda seems to recognize its talent at creating flashy items, since anything you pick up can be examined in your inventory from all angles, from every piece of Glass armor to a purple mountain flower. For the best view of armor, though, you'll want to switch out to third-person view, which in Skyrim is a far more viable way to play than it was in Oblivion. I still prefer the traditional first-person combat and interaction for the sense of immersion it provides, but the third-person mode isn't the vanity mode it once was.\nJOIN THE SKYRIM WIKIQUEST GUIDEVAMPIRISMBECOME A WEREWOLFGET MARRIEDBUGS AND GLITCHES\nSend us your tips »Tweet us your tips »As good as the visuals are in the Xbox 360 version of Skyrim, there are a few drawbacks. Even with the game installed, load times are lengthy and frequent. Every time you fast travel, every time you enter a building or town with a door, you'll need to sit through a load. You'll also experience framerate drops depending on how much happens to be onscreen. The PC crowd should be happy to hear that, assuming you've got a powerful machine, The Elder Scrolls V looks far and away the best. The draw distance can be pushed way back, letting you see clear across enormous spaces, and you benefit from a higher visual quality throughout, as well as dramatically shortened load times, to the point where they barely exist at all.\nThe only downside of the PC version is the interface, which is elaborately presented and a breeze to use on consoles, but is inefficiently laid out for keyboard and mouse controls. To cut down on time spent in menus with both versions you can assign almost anything – armor, weapons, spells, shouts, pieces of meat – as a favorite. This menu can then quickly be brought up during a fight, pausing the action, so you swiftly adjust to the changing nature of a battle without having to page through the main menu system, though on PC an option to also bind items and spells to number keys would have been appreciated. (Edit: It turns out you can do this, just hit the number keys over items with your favorites menu open. Sorry for the mistake.)\nAs tends to be the case with games as large and complex as Skyrim, there are bugs. Some are minor, like dead bodies jittering madly or poking through walls. Your hands may momentarily disappear, equipping an armored face mask may actually turn you into an invisible man, and mammoths may soar into the air for no apparent reason. More serious glitches exist as well, such as those that prevent you from completing quests. How widespread these issues are is tough to say, maybe you'll have a glitch-free experience, but chances are you'll at least run into a few. Along with the occasional game crash, these issues can be periodically irritating, but given the overwhelming number of things Skyrim gets right, putting up with them is a small price to pay.\nimageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpcmedia.ign.com%2Fpc%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F121%2F1212033%2Fthe-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-20111110083439585.jpg&caption=\nVerdict\nIt's difficult to ever feel completely satisfied with a play session of Skyrim. There's always one more pressing quest, one more unexplored tract of land, one more skill to increase, one more butterfly to catch. It's a mesmerizing game that draws you into an finely crafted fictional space packed with content that consistently surprises. The changes made since Oblivion are many, and result in a more focused and sensible style of play, where the effects of every decision are easily seen. Featuring the same kind of thrilling freedom of choice The Elder Scrolls series is known for along with beautiful visuals and a stirring soundtrack, playing Skyrim is a rare kind of intensely personal, deeply rewarding experience, and one of the best role-playing games yet produced.",

    "title": "Red Dead Redemption",
    "review": "The American West has made actors famous and writers rich. It has inspired children on the playground and grizzled country singers alike. Its stories of heroes and bandits, gold rushes and simple homesteaders have been fictionalized and romanticized to the point that they're known the world over. And yet, video game makers have either ignored the setting or attempted to squeeze it into existing game conventions with limited success. That has all changed now that Rockstar, the group made famous for its Grand Theft Auto series, turned its eye towards the Wild West. No game maker has approached the period with as much passion and power as Red Dead Redemption. This is the new bar that all Westerns must strive to reach.\nCheck out our full video: Why We Love Red Dead Redemption.\n\nIt's tempting to say that Red Dead Redemption is ahead of its time, but the reality is that this is a game of and for the times. Rockstar shows an uncanny ability to hold a mirror up to society and remind us that present day hot button issues like racism, immigration, federal government power and personal freedoms are not only nothing new, they are deeply ingrained in American society. They are forces that helped to shape America into what it is, and their inclusion in Red Dead Redemption gives it a sense of authenticity that videogames in general lack.\n\nBut rather than preaching politics at you, Red Dead Redemption puts you in the shoes of the relatively neutral John Marston. This former outlaw gone straight has found that history has a way of catching up with you. Those who were once his friends have now become enemies, leaving Marston alone and fighting for his future in a lawless land. It's a setup that is almost cliche, but this is only the beginning of your adventure.\n\nThe storyline of Red Dead Redemption will take you all over a vast swath of countryside that straddles the border between the U.S. and Mexico. Along the way you'll meet, assist, and spill blood with a fantastic cast of supporting characters as Marston attempts to set things straight. The characters are wonderful with top notch dialogue and voice acting -- all good enough to make you feel a part of the world.\n\nIf there is any criticism I could level at the story, it's that Marston occasionally feels divorced from the action, his motivations muddled as he is all too willing to help anybody that asks for it despite his own pressing matters. A simple, \"I'm being made to do this,\" from Marston is all you'll get out of the protagonist for much of the game while secondary characters drive the tale along, which was a bit of a disappointment for me. This all changes towards the end, however, as Red Dead Redemption builds towards a shattering climax that is amongst the best I've ever seen in a video game.\nFollowing that main story will take you roughly 20 hours from start to finish, though most will find that there is so much to do that it is difficult to focus on one thing. This is made by Rockstar, after all, and their heritage as masters of the open world sandbox game is not lost.\n\nHerding cattle and breaking mustangs? Check. Tracking down outlaws for bounty? You can take them dead or alive. Treasure hunting and sharpshooting challenges? There are dozens of them. The side missions and quests range from the little things like playing horse shoes or poker to big shootouts at bandit hideouts. There are even some that are fleshed out enough to be a part of the main storyline. You could spend hours just riding around trying to track down all of the components of a new outfit for Marston, or hunting wild game and picking herbs and desert flowers. The Rockstar Social Club, a free online community that connects to the game, offers additional challenges and leaderboards to encourage even more replay. If you're looking for one game to occupy you for months, this is it.\n\n\n\n\nAs you begin to make a name for yourself, the world of Red Dead Redemption adapts to your fame. The question of ethics and morality is left up to the player. If you want to be a salty drunk that assaults women and robs stagecoaches, that's your prerogative. Others might prefer to help the needy and be more honorable. Though there is a legal system in Red Dead Redemption that will keep the most villainous in check, you're free to take the high or low road in most any situation. A little morality meter, alongside a separate fame bar tracks your actions and the citizens you come across will begin to react to your renown. It's a system that allows for a huge amount of freedom and then rewards you for exploring it.\n\nLike many Rockstar games, that freedom may ruffle a few feathers. Several of the actions you're able to perform will surely be considered indecent by some.\n\nBut all of that is left up to the player, and as it turns out there isn't just a lot to do -- there's a lot to see. The world feels alive with something happening everywhere you turn. Birds come screaming out of the bushes as your horse thunders by. Trains whistle while storms come blowing in to fill low-lying areas with fresh puddles. Around the next bend might be a carriage being robbed by bandits, its poor inhabitants crying out for help, or there might be a cougar or bear ready to tear down your horse and bring Marston to his knees.\n\nWalk through town and you might see a drunk assaulting a prostitute, a lynch mob dragging a poor soul through the main drag, or a person who caught wind of your fame and has come looking for a duel. The simulation -- though its aggressive nature occasionally creates a goofy backdrop to Marston's conversations -- is always presenting something new and exciting.\n\nWELCOME TO THE WILD WEST.\n\n\nWhat is most impressive about this sandbox is how fun it is to simply hop on a horse and take off across the prairie. Red Dead Redemption is a gorgeous game with an incredible attention to detail. The art direction, particularly the careful consideration paid to the color palette and geology of the land, is superb. Exactly the right amount of red is used to make the dusty hills and plateaus come to life, the sunsets look breathtaking, and the purple mountains call out with the majesty they're known for. The area you can explore is immense and dotted with towns, ruins, and different environments that all feel hand crafted and unique. Just ride out towards the sunset and listen to the exceptional soundtrack and you'll feel teleported to a whole new world.\n\nThe setting of Red Dead Redemption, leaving out the interactive elements, is an achievement in itself. Add in the smooth way the world reacts and moves and you have a game that is stunning. Horses gallop realistically. Bodies dangling from those horses -- be it from a rope or from a foot caught in a stirrup -- animate near perfectly. Shoot a bandit in the hat and it will fly off, or aim for the legs and he'll stumble to the ground while you prepare to hogtie him. None of the animations are canned, which means every time you go out into the desert to play you'll have a slightly different and awesome outcome.\n\nIT'S A GORGEOUS GAME.\n\n\nThe only slight detractor from this wonderful world is that Red Dead Redemption doesn't have quite the same level of polish as we've come to expect out of a Rockstar game. While playing I noticed the occasional bug (once during a cutscene the game rendered two of the same character doing different animations, creating a weird ghosting effect) and the game did freeze during loading a couple of times. The game's graphics engine can't always keep up with the action, either, resulting in some visual hiccups here or there. Given the scope of what has been accomplished here, Red Dead Redemption is actually a relatively smooth experience, but it isn't perfect.\n\nThe developer's pedigree must also be mentioned when talking about the game itself. Some will describe Red Dead Redemption as Grand Theft Auto in the Wild West and in some ways that description is accurate. Many of the same presentational elements created in the GTA universe are used here, included extended conversations during rides to the next mission and the layout of the mini-map. In that regard, GTA veterans will feel right at home, though they will find little improvements to the formula in things like better checkpoint and mission replay systems.\n\n\nThis isn't just a redo of Grand Theft Auto with a different backdrop, however. Rockstar did a remarkable job of taking only the elements of its past games that work while adapting the flow and the controls to the Western setting. The Dead Eye slow motion effect makes you feel like a classic gunslinger. The confluence of a wide-open setting and turn of the century technology offer the perfect mix of civilization and wilderness. And the greater emphasis on ambient missions and random encounters makes the West feel as wild and untamed as your childhood daydreams imagined it.\n\nRed Dead Redemption handles well, too, outside of touchy horse controls that make the mounts seem a little too eager to jump over a fence or into a river. The target assist makes attacking enemies while riding a horse a breeze, but it also makes the combat a little too easy at times. The cover system works similarly to GTA IV, but there just didn't seem much need for it when I could simply walk ahead slowly ripping off shots with perfect accuracy. I died here or there, but rarely did Red Dead Redemption feel particularly challenging.\n\nEven after you've beaten Red Dead Redemption and completed 100% of the side challenges, there's still much more to do. The game continues online with cooperative and competitive modes for up to 16 players simultaneously. The competitive action includes team and free-for-all game types including standard shootouts and a capture the flag style of game. These are a decent distraction and can be quite fun -- especially at the start when each game begins with every player standing in a circle ready to draw pistols. Any hardcore player might end up a bit annoyed by the respawn system, however, which has a tendency to start you right next to an opponent. Without the other trimmings that I'll get to in a second, it isn't the kind of multiplayer experience I'd make a steady part of my gaming rotation.\n\nBE AS BAD AS YOU WANT TO BE.\n\n\nThe reason to keep coming back to Red Dead Redemption for months and months is called Free Roam. This is the multiplayer lobby of sorts, but the concept has been cranked up a notch to be an entire game in itself. Free Roam lets up to 16 players join into one world and then explore the entirety of the single-player map. You can form posses and take part in little skirmishes, simply shoot each other in the face, assault bandit hideouts and forts as a team, or just ride across the countryside together while taking part in hunting and gathering challenges.\n\nA large number of the side distractions from the single-player game are here, as well as a whole extra set of little objectives. By completing the missions, killing each other, or playing in competitive games, you can gain experience and begin leveling up to unlock new character models, modes, and better mounts to ride. Free Roam by itself is meaty enough to be an entirely separate game and it would still be awesome.\n\nSOMETIMES YOU EAT THE BEAR...\n\n\nSeveral special cooperative missions are being made for download as well, but they were not available at the time of this review and so they weren't considered. The first pack has been announced as free, though, so keep an eye out for it.\nVerdict\nRed Dead Redemption is a must-play game. Rockstar has taken the Western to new heights and created one of the deepest, most fun, and most gorgeous games around. You can expect the occasional bug or visual hiccup, but you can also expect a fantastic game that offers the Western experience we've all been waiting for. Red Dead Redemption is a complete game in every sense -- both the single player and multiplayer modes are excellent -- and still manages to offer an attention to detail you rarely see from a game of this scope.",

    "title": "Chrono Trigger",
    "review": "It feels like we've come to the end of an era. It's been over four and a half years since the Wii's Virtual Console first went live. In that time, we've seen the re-release of nearly four hundred different retro titles – some masterpieces, some duds and lots of in-between, average \"classics\" of yesteryear drawn from the back catalogs of the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64 and several other old-school consoles.\n\nIt's been an interesting journey, with some of us reliving bits and pieces of our childhoods and others discovering these titles for the very first time. And now, with Chrono Trigger, it feels like the journey's come to an end.\n\nChrono Trigger is one of the best video games ever made. A universally cherished role-playing game, it was originally released for the Super Nintendo in 1995. Its creation is the stuff of legend, as it was developed by a dream team of the most talented RPG makers of the 16-bit era, all coming together to work on this one epic project. And though it would be easy to write pages upon pages to explain its appeal, I'll attempt just three key points to sum up what makes it so timeless.\n\nThe first, appropriately enough, is time travel.\n\n\nCrono is the name of our silent protagonist in Chrono Trigger. A wide-eyed, wild-haired boy living in the year 1000 A.D., he becomes thrust into a quest to save the world when a mysterious portal in time opens up and swallows his friend Marle. He boldly jumps in after her, setting in motion a story that has you following his adventures back in time to the past, forward in time to the distant future and every other point in-between – as what begins as a rescue mission for one young girl escalates into a battle for the fate of the planet.\n\nThe time-traveling concept set Chrono Trigger apart from other RPGs, as its many different eras of time are expertly interwoven and your actions in the past accurately influence the future. Other games of the SNES era began to explore the idea of alternate worlds or parallel dimensions, but here in Chrono Trigger you see the entire existence of a planet play out from the dawn of mankind all the way to beyond the apocalypse. That alone would have made Chrono Trigger a hit – but time travel was just the first of its many special qualities.\n\nThe battle system is second, as it was, and still is, wonderfully unique. You control a party of up to three heroes at a time, fighting foes right where you encounter them in the environment. There's no visual cut-away to some separate battlefield screen like in so many other RPGs – here, you see a baddie and you attack it right there.\n\nWhat's more, the battle mechanics present an incredible variety of opportunities for teamwork. Every character has a basic Attack command, and can use Items too. Standard stuff. But the third option – \"Tech\" – is where it gets interesting. Selecting Tech lets you unleash more damaging assaults, magic spells and support maneuvers with individual heroes, but you can also combine more than one characters' moves together to create even more powerful combos.\n\nCrono's a skilled swordsman who can leap and slash up enemies alone, for instance, while Marle's more magically gifted with the innate element of Water. Put the two of them together, though, and Marle can freeze Crono's sword mid-air so that his strike hits with the impact of an icy glacier – or Crono can spin his blade in circles while Marle casts a healing spell, to disperse the curative aura over every ally in the battle.\n\nThe interplay between the game's half-dozen or so different playable characters is wonderfully satisfying, as each one is developed with a distinctive personality and individual sidequests that reinforce who they are and really get you to like them. And the fact that there are more than three characters to choose from, while you can only use three at a time, helps fuel the game's third key point of appeal – replayability.\n\n\nChrono Trigger innovated the concept of a \"New Game +\" in which, after completing the story and seeing the credits roll, you could choose to restart the adventure with your powered-up, experience-pumped characters intact. It was a great idea, as it made things speedier on subsequent playthroughs as you attempted to achieve a different ending the second, third or ninth time through – because Chrono Trigger also innovated in offering tons of different ending sequences you could earn, depending on the choices you made while playing.\n\nAll of this time-jumping, three-hero tag-team battling and powered-up questing for more and more different story conclusions all came together to create one incredible masterpiece of a game, wrapped up with the most beautiful artwork and the greatest soundtrack any SNES title had ever seen. It should go without saying that Chrono Trigger is still worth your time and money today, and that it comes with my highest recommendation for 800 of your Wii Points.\n\nSome naysayers will offer their opinions opposing such a purchase, pointing out that this same game has been recently re-released on the Nintendo DS in an edition that includes a couple of new dungeons and a retranslated script. I hold nothing against that version, or even the PlayStation 1 port that added anime-style cutscenes to the story 10 years ago. But this is the original. This is the game as it was – as it first existed, as American SNES owners first experienced it on the SNES in 1995. And spending just eight bucks to reclaim that same experience – old poorly translated enemy names and all – is, to me, the best of what the Virtual Console has always been about.\nVerdict\nThere will still be more Virtual Console titles released after this. The Wii's service isn't over quite yet. But we're just days away from the launch of the Nintendo 3DS eShop and its new, second-edition version of the VC concept. So here, with this re-release of a title still rightly argued as perhaps the very best video game ever made, it feels right to call this chapter closed. So whether it continues to offer dozens more classics from yesteryear going forward, or if it really is winding down to its final conclusion, support the original Virtual Console with a purchase of this gaming great – it's a download service that has sometimes been frustrating to deal with, but at the end of it all it really has let us travel back through time.",

    "title": "Portal 2",
    "review": "The original Portal had the element of surprise. Its style of first-person physics-based puzzle gameplay was unique. GLaDOS, the murderous robotic villain, was new and vibrant and evil in the most charming way. Cake jokes and songs about surviving dismemberment were still hilarious. It was short, succinct and essential. Creating a sequel without playing all the same notes and making it feel like Portal: The Longer Version is a tough task. For Valve, it's apparently no problem.\nFrom the first moments of waking up in the rusting Aperture Science facility to right before the credits roll, Portal 2 rarely falters. The world is bigger, the story thicker, and the character development more surprising. The mania of GLaDOS, the facility's operator, is molded into unexpected forms alongside a host of brutally funny personalities. The history of the Aperture Science facility is filled in, character origins discussed, and though its pacing suffers as it occasionally strikes a more serious tone, an abundance of cruel jokes and cheerfully sincere death threats prevent it from losing its sarcastic charm. When you're not staring at your screen with wrinkled, pained expression on your face trying to figure out a puzzle, expect to be laughing.\nYou still play as Chell, dragged back into Aperture after the events of the first game. You soon meet Wheatley, a spherical robot, voiced by Stephen Merchant (The Ricky Gervais Show, Extras) who helps you through the early stages. It's difficult to overstate how Merchant's obvious enthusiasm for the role benefits the game. No word Wheatley speaks is without witty inflection, and the consistently clever writing perfectly complements the onscreen action. It's easy to be be just as concerned about missing lines of dialogue as about progressing through the puzzles, especially during Wheatley and GLaDOS' verbal sparring matches.\nThe attention to detail throughout is nothing short of stunning.\n“\nThe attention to detail throughout is nothing short of stunning. The facility is in a state of disrepair at the beginning. Once GLaDOS whirs into action, so does the facility, becoming an extension of her body and personality. When you enter a room mechanized crane arms and wall plates spin and shift with an urgency like you walked in on them with their pants down. As Portal 2 progresses, the environments expand from claustrophobic test chambers to yawning underground chasms. Metal girders and structural supports break and crash into each another, snapping apart in chaotic and natural ways, consistently serving not only to entertain the eye but to expand our understanding of the game's characters. The core appeal of something like Portal will never be the visuals, but it's still impressive how much mileage Valve is getting out of its Source technology first used for Half-Life 2 in 2004.\nVIEW 49 IMAGES\n\n\nThough there's a much bigger emphasis on story and character development in Portal 2, you'll spend a lot of time tangling with spatial reasoning puzzles in test chambers. Valve brings back the same portal gun while greatly expanding the number of gameplay toys. The gun shoots two linked portals through which you and objects can pass and momentum is maintained. To get from one test chamber to the next and through the guts of Aperture's vastness, you'll use your portals to redirect energy beams, coat surfaces with globular gel that makes you bounce or run at high speeds, pass over gaping pits with bridges of light and manipulate cylindrical tractor beams. Arriving at a solution will require quick reactions just as often as clear thinking, as portals sometimes need to be repositioned while soaring through the air or before timers run out. This isn't a first-person shooter in the traditional sense, but at times it can feel like one as you zoom in with your portal gun to spy distant targets and frantically adjust your aim and fire with precision.\nArriving at a solution will require quick reactions just as often as clear thinking.\n“\nNo matter how complicated the puzzles get, the solutions are always sensible. Sometimes you'll \"get it\" right away and adjust lasers with lens blocks to activate platforms to reach switches. Other times you'll have no idea what to do, exhausting seemingly all possible options until, eventually, a solution so plainly obvious sparks in your brain and you curse yourself for being such a dolt. Valve does an excellent job of presenting you with all the necessary clues without slapping a set of instructions onscreen to explain the way forward. Even when multiple mechanics are mixed into puzzles like jump pads, tractor beams, light bridges and gels, I never felt getting stuck was due to unreasonable or poor design, only my ability to decipher it.\n\n\nAs good as the single-player story is, the co-operative is the real highlight of Portal 2. The beginning of the co-op picks up right after the end of the single-player game, giving you and your partner control of two robots, and serves as a continuation of the story of Aperture Science. It features fewer characters than the single-player mode but is still filled with enough sharp writing, deadpan jokes and absurd humor to keep you entertained between puzzle sections and provide motivation toward an end goal. Better yet, instead of simply recycling puzzle designs from the single-player portion, the inclusion of another player significantly alters the way you need to think.\nIn Portal 2, communication is vital to success.\n“\nThat's because each of the robotic co-operative characters carries a portal gun, which means two guns and four portals. Valve takes full advantage of the increased capacity for dimensional holes by raising the level of challenge and coordination required. As is obvious if you've ever played Left 4 Dead, Valve knows how a good co-operative mode requires a game design that doesn't simply encourage but requires you to work together. In Portal 2, communication is vital to success.\n\nGetting through can be frustrating, especially if you're playing with someone you don't know, because there's no diffusion of responsibility here. You can't hide in a corner and wait for someone else to do all the work. The contributions of each person involved are plain to see, and Valve's developed numerous tools to help make communication as smooth as possible.\n\nYou can set context-sensitive markers on parts of the environment to wordlessly indicate where a portal should be placed, where a partner should move, and even trigger a countdown clock to synchronize when switches should be hit or buttons pressed. The indicators may feel superfluous at first, but once you're setting up four portal chains of light bridges to block turret fire or redirecting edgeless safety cubes as they fly through open air over bottomless pits, it's obvious how useful they can be. Barely a moment will go by in silence while playing Portal 2 with another, except when you're listening to GLaDOS belittle your intelligence with endearing sarcasm.\n\n\nReally the only place Portal 2 falters is in the second act of its single-player mode, where the pacing sags and the story becomes more concerned with the past than anything else. Even so, as compared to many other linear first-person games where the stories are little more than shrink wrap and glorify a blood-is-progress philosophy, Portal 2's mid-game doldrums are relatively far more creative and confidently original. Valve's sequel serves as the anti-Call of Duty. Portal 2 is a first-person thrill ride from beginning to end that challenges you to think without failing to entertain.\nVerdict\nThe original Portal benefitted from its brevity. It had a concise story paired with inventive first-person puzzle mechanics that challenged you to be creative while pulling the trigger. Portal 2 makes the original look like the prototype it was. It's filled with a larger cast of characters vividly brought to life through brilliant writing and some of the best voice acting in video games. Its puzzles are challenging without being unreasonable, and, once you're finished with the single-player mode, one of the best co-operative experiences on the market awaits. Valve cuts no corners and finds ways to make you care about everything from the major characters to the cubes used to solve puzzles. From the beginning of the single-player story to the end of the co-op mode, Portal 2 is a novel, unforgettable experience.",

    "title": "Uncharted 2: Among Thieves",
    "review": "More than any other game to date, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune seems to define the PlayStation 3. Naughty Dog's 2007 jungle romp starring the one and only Nathan Drake gave gamers a taste of what it would be like to play as an acrobatically-inclined Indiana Jones. With stunning visuals (that still rank amongst the best in gaming today), a fantastically told story, great puzzles and high-octane gunplay, it's easily one of the best titles of this console generation.\nNow Naughty Dog returns to the spotlight with Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. Both expectedly and amazingly, Naughty Dog has indeed bested Nate's first adventure and has created a sequel that is not only bigger and better in practically every way, but also packs a multiplayer component that could be released as its own separate, full-priced game and people would stand in line to hand over their cash.\nYes, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is fantastic.\nTrying to remain as spoiler-free as possible, I'll just say that the story starts off about a year or so after the events of the first game and begins with Nate and a few fellow thieves working on finding Marco Polo's lost treasure fleet. Of course, things aren't quite that simple and the cast winds up going on a much grander adventure, one that takes them half-way around the world.\nThat's about as far as I want to go with the storyline, though some of the trailers out there actually reveal a little more than that. The important part here though is that this game doesn't just take place on a single island and instead changes locales a handful of times over the course of the adventure. The result is that the pacing feels better and faster, and even though you're technically doing the same sort of shooting, climbing and puzzle solving throughout the game, the different ways the scenes are presented gives Among Thieves a greater sense of gameplay variety than the original.\nThe great storytelling extends to the character development, which has been turned up a good notch or two. Almost everyone with more than two lines of dialogue has an interesting reason for doing what they're doing (though the main bad guy is just bad), and the way that everyone interacts with one another is realistic and interesting. Almost every character is unpredictable in some way, but not in a forced or unnatural manner.\nThe story itself twists and turns throughout the course of the game, as you might expect, and for the most part it's a solid tale. Nate and his pals go through a lot, so it does a good job of reeling you in and keeping you hooked until the end.\nWhile I'd say the story is quite good overall, I wouldn't say that it's perfect. Without giving anything away, while most of the story has solid footing in real-world lore and legend, it does start to veer away from this at some point in a way that could have been handled better. Still, it's told very, very well through the use of fantastic cutscenes and acting, and will keep you guessing at what'll happen until the very end.\nAs for the gameplay itself, Uncharted 2 -- like the original Drake's Fortune -- tasks you with gunfights, environmental navigation or puzzle solving. While a lot of the mechanics are identical to the first title, everything has been blended together a little better, especially the combat and navigation.\nThis is in large part due to the settings that you'll fight in. Whereas the first game generally had you walk into an area with lots of cover, set up behind a wall and then take guys out as best you could, Uncharted 2 offers a lot more variety and options in how these sequences play out thanks to the fantastic level design. Rather than fighting on flat ground, almost every battle scene features multiple levels and areas to use to your advantage. If you want to stay on the ground and take guys out the old fashioned way, you're more than welcome to. But you can also climb to higher ground and use height to your advantage, or flank the enemy by moving from cover to cover and changing your tactics as the battle unfolds around you. While the game is still very much a linear tale, taking you from point to specific point, you're offered many more options in how you approach and deal with battles.\nOne thing that plays a big part in this is that stealth is a much more prominent element of the game, and it's actually a very useful tactic to take advantage of when you approach a situation. If an enemy doesn't see you and you attack him, you'll perform a silent stealth takedown. While you could do similar things in the original game, the way that it's implemented and the way sections are set up allow you to actually use it well. There are a couple spots in the game where I took down four or five enemies before the gunfire starting whizzing around, greatly improving my chances of survival. It's even possible to avoid a big fight entirely if you can clear an area of enemies silently as there won't be anyone around to call in for reinforcements.\nOf course, you don't have to use any stealth at all if you just want to start popping caps when you roll into a fight. Well, that is except for a sequence near the start of the game where you have to be stealthy as you're not allowed to be seen or outright kill anyone. The problem here is that your route isn't as obvious as it could be and you only need to, and perhaps are even realistically able to, take down three or four guys out of a room packed to the gills with guards. If you don't do things in a fairly specific order, you'll fail and have to restart. The most problematic bit here is that two enemies that you can take down are in tricky spots. One that you have to take down hangs out near a banister that's only a little higher than you stand. You can't just grab him because he's too high up, and half the time that I'd jump up to grab the ledge I would wind up startling him. If you know exactly what you're doing here then you could get through this sequence in about a minute or so, but due to its trial-and-error nature, I was probably stuck here for a good 15 or 20 minutes before moving on.\nBut fortunately, everything after this is smooth sailing. In fact, this is one of those rare games that keeps getting better and better as it goes on. The first half felt like a nice -- if somewhat subtle -- improvement in the gameplay department over the original, but once you hit the half-way point, everything kicks into full swing and you start getting into jaw-dropping sequences.\nHowever, one complaint that we had with the first game is still present here: you'll get to rooms of enemies where soldiers just keep on coming, wave after wave. Now, from a design and technical standpoint this solution makes sense because if you started in a room with 30 guys already present, you'd never have an opening to fire back as you would just be pelted with constant gunfire. But, it's still a little aggravating to get into a fight, clear the room and then have a half-dozen more guys walk in and start shooting up the place. Perhaps if the battles weren't as concentrated in single rooms and you would have to continue to fight as you moved down hallways this would feel a little more realistic, but it is what it is.\nSo, aside from that, the combat is improved and nicely makes use of your climbing abilities. Similarly, though the mechanics are essentially unchanged, the bits of the game where you have to scale the environment are taken up a level as well. The sequences where you're solely focused on navigating the world are usually visually stunning, and some even incorporate moving bits that make you think about where you're going. It's hard to explain why it's better than the original title without spoiling anything, but suffice it to say that during a number of these segments, even though I'd be doing essentially the same stuff that I did in the last game, I found myself in awe of what and where I was climbing. Great stuff.\nMy only real complaint, which is a forced one that I'm just mentioning to put it out there, is that the climbing paths are still very linear, and from what I was able to tell, there's only one way through most every section. If you're somewhere and there isn't a door, you know that you need to look around for something that you can grab to begin climbing. It's sort of a, \"well, I don't know where this'll take me, but it's the only thing I can do\" sort of scenario. Again, this isn't really a complaint that I'm knocking the game for, but in the future it would be nice to either have multiple ways to get somewhere, or a more sensible reason for climbing up bricks that I can just happen to scale.\nThe third piece of the Uncharted puzzle is, well, puzzles. The first title blended action, climbing and puzzle solving in great fashion, and though it's handled differently this time around, Naughty Dog has solved the equation perfectly again. Whereas it seems to me like there are less puzzles this time, the ones that you do come across are complicated and very involved. Instead of peppering small interactive quizzes throughout the game, you'll come to roomfuls of things to solve, many of which are multi-staged puzzles. What's cool is that instead of having Sir Francis Drake's journal, Nate keeps his own this time around that you can freely flip through. And you'll need to, as some puzzles require multiple pages of clues.\nOne in particular referenced a good four or five pages of the book, so you need to look at what's going on, flip through the book, do some stuff and then go back to the book again. It doesn't feel forced, and due to the intricacies therein, I felt more accomplished when I passed them. Great stuff here.\nOne thing that I didn't touch on when I was talking about combat was the AI. Those of you who played the original (and if you haven't, head to the store ASAP) know that Nate was up against some very smart foes. They'd take cover, use grenades well and were generally fun to fight because of this. For better or worse, things are about the same this time around. Honestly, I didn't really expect an obvious improvement because they were already so good, so that's actually praise rather than a complaint. I will say though that the AI continues to make great use of the environment even though it's generally way more complicated this time around, which is great.\nNow, while the opponent AI was already impressive, your companion AI is absolutely phenomenal. You're almost always with someone else this time around, which was something that I was a little concerned about when I had originally heard this as friendly AI almost always gets in the way. Not here, and not ever.\nIt really feels like they're with you rather than in your way, thinking for themselves and doing stuff that real people would do. If there are climbing sequences, the computer will either quickly go ahead or stay back and wait for you to pass it first. If there's a gunfight, it'll find its own cover, take care of itself and stay out of your way. The only time in the game that I thought the AI did something that I wasn't pleased with was once when I came to a room where two factions where fighting, we were hidden in cover and I wanted to wait the battle out. After staying quiet for about 30 seconds and playing along, Chloe popped up and joined the battle, dragging me into it as well. That's it. During the other ten hours of the adventure, of which a good eight-plus is spent with someone at your side, they were always complementary rather than hurtful and often actually very helpful.\nIt's impossible to talk about Uncharted 2 without mentioning its visuals. I've already touched on the fantastic presentation in the cutscenes, but there are some scenes that you'll play in that will have your jaw on the floor. The world is packed with bits of detail that do nothing for gameplay, but do a lot to draw you into the world and make you feel like this is a real place. The texture detail is astounding, the amount of random stuff everywhere is mind boggling, the lighting is some of the best we've ever seen and the overall art direction is phenomenal. And of course, let me not forget to mention the amazing animation, killer explosions and pretty much every other pixel on the screen.\nIt's kind of amazing to say this, but the actual gameplay oftentimes looks better than the cutscenes. This is truly one of the best looking games that I've ever seen, and you could easily argue that it's the best overall on the PlayStation 3 (when you can argue that against the likes of Killzone 2 and Metal Gear Solid 4, well, that's saying something).\nSo that's Uncharted 2: Among Thieves in a large nutshell. Or is it? Yes indeed, this time around Naughty Dog went out of its way to include an online component, one that features both versus and cooperative gameplay. To say that the multiplayer is fun would be a massive understatement. For my money, this is one of the best multiplayer experiences that you'll find in any game around, and considering that the single-player portion alone is enough to easily warrant your $60, well, this almost feels like Naughty Dog has given us an extra game for free.\nThe list of options and features here is immense. For competitive play you get a good variety of modes including stuff like team deathmatch, elimination, capture the flag (or treasure in this case), a zone control mode and more. You can gain ranks, which then in turn allows you to buy perks (like the ability to hold more ammo or reload faster) with money that you earn while playing. Levels here are scenes adapted from the single-player game, so you're getting the same fantastic design elements with lots of spots to take advantage of, places to hide and use for cover, and so on and so forth.\n.For the cooperative stuff, you have a handful of options here. A survival mode is exactly what it sounds like - you and a couple friends hole up in a spot and take out wave after wave of enemies that get progressively tougher for as long as you can. It's fun and very challenging, but for my money the meat here is the co-op mode. Rather than playing through the entire game with a couple friends, you instead jump into specific scenarios that have you save some folks, grab a treasure or something straightforward like that. However, it's quite a bit different than what you'll come across in the single-player game as enemies don't just pop up in front of you, they come from everywhere, quickly and in large numbers. You absolutely must communicate here (using a headset is key to winning) and you have to constantly check your surroundings lest you be shot point-blank in the back of the head with a shotgun.\nThere's a lot to the strategy for every mode of multiplayer offered in Uncharted 2, but I don't really need to delve into any of that because it all plays exactly like the single-player game, which is fantastic news. For a game that relies so much on environmental traversal to be able to offer the same exact mechanics while playing online, Naughty Dog has really tied everything together brilliantly.\nIf you like to get up high and drop down on your opponents in the single-player game, you can do that online. If you like to stealthily flank guys online and take them out silently, you can do that in the single-player game. The multiplayer is both a massive and natural extension of the single-player experience, and the fact that Naughty Dog was able to pull it off so seamlessly is applause-worthy.\nVerdict\nIf you're reading this, it was unlikely that you weren't already going to buy Uncharted 2: Among Thieves on day one. Really, you just wanted to know how good it is, and fortunately I can say that it's very, very good. It's easily one of the best games on the system, blending fantastic presentation and visuals with gameplay that is practically second to none. And then there's the stellar multiplayer which you'll probably be playing until Uncharted 3 ships. No, Uncharted 2 is not perfect, but it's closer than pretty much any other game out there these days.",

    "title": "The Sims 3",
    "review": "It's been five years since the last Sims title for the Nintendo DS was released, and the title offered more linear gameplay style than its PC counterpart. It was good but not quite the true god-simulator experience people have grown to love and expect from a Sims game. That's changed with The Sims 3 for the DS, as it stays true to the life-simulator formula and also includes Karma powers, a potent way to help or harm your Sims.\n\nBecause DS version is rated \"E\" for Everyone (console and PC versions are \"T\" for Teen), you can't kill Sims. You can torture them if you want, but starvation or fatigue lands them in the hospital instead of the morgue. You also can't \"Woo-Hoo,\" partially because of the rating and because your household can only be a maximum of two people, so there's no room to reproduce. If you can look past those omissions, you'll find the game is largely the same.\n\nYou'll create a Sim (you can only create a household of one) or choose a pre-made family (can be up to two Sims) to start out with and then dictate their lives. The creation tool offers an in-depth way to customize your Sims -- pick their physical appearance, different outfits, voice, favorite things, traits and lifetime wish. Depending on your Sim's characteristics, these goals can range from learning every recipe in the game to becoming the top dog in the criminal career path. Once you have your household of Sims, you'll manage their daily lives making sure their needs of hunger, hygiene, social interaction, fun, bladder and energy are all met.\n\n\nRedesigned to utilize the dual screens of the DS, the majority of your Sim's information (like their Lifetime Wish, Job, Traits, etc.) is sequestered on the top screen. You can tab through the info up there by using the left and right shoulder buttons, and all this frees up the bottom screen for the action. The controls work well and you can move your Sim through everyday life by tapping locations and objects on the screen. The camera is also handled nicely here – you can follow Sims by zooming in, out and around using the face buttons while the D-pad moves the camera around the map. Together, it all works well and the optional tutorial does a fine job of taking you through the motions.\n\nHowever digging into the menus can get a little confusing, especially if you put the game down for a while and then pick it back up. There are obvious symbols for using your phone or traveling into town, but trying to open up the screen where you can buy furniture can be a hassle.\n\nWhile guiding Sims along their lives, their desires will pop up on screen for you to accept or decline. It ranges from small things like buying a book on Logic to mastering a specific skill, and every time you complete a Wish, you'll be rewarded with some Lifetime Happiness points (the amount varies depending on how big the task is). Lifetime Happiness points are important for Karma powers and can also be used to purchase perks like getting complimentary entertainment or being a professional slacker at your job. The rewards are amusing and useful, so they're a great incentive for fulfilling your Sim's Wishes.\n\nOpportunities also play a bigger role in the DS version – they pop up randomly and come in a wide range -- from something simple like cooking hot dogs to going undercover and questioning another Sim. Opportunities have a time limit and reward you with money and/or skill or career boosts, so you'll need to pick and choose carefully so your Sim isn't constantly failing them.\n\n\nThe customization that you'd expect from a Sims game is available but understandably not as robust as the PC or console versions. There's no landscaping, but you can still re-paint your walls, re-tile the floors, and knock down or build walls however you choose. There's a variety of objects for you to buy and make your Sims life richer. The clothing is also more limited (you can't change patterns or colors) but there's still a good selection of pre-rendered threads to choose from, but you can't mix together an outfit that might offend the Fashion Police, like knee-high boots and baggy pants.\n\nKarma powers are included on the DS, but are a bit different than the ones included on consoles. There's a mixture of practical powers like The Muse (increases cooking and painting skills) and playful powers like Winter Wonderland, which changes the season. There are nine total powers, with six good and three bad. Unfortunately, it might take you a while to be able to actually use any of them.\n\nThe biggest alteration to Karma powers for the DS is the way they're unlocked. Gathering enough Lifetime Happiness points (which you get by completing Wishes) automatically uncovers a new Karma power, but then you have to search for a mystery object located in an undisclosed location in order to activate it. This process is a bit annoying, especially because there are \"hints\" that actually don't help you at all and can even lead you astray. It's disappointing that Karma powers are so well-implemented on the console version but the handheld makes them feel like more trouble than they're worth. Still, it's really a bonus more than a full-fledged feature, so you can ignore it entirely or look at it like a treasure hunt.\n\nThough the handheld offers less customization, it makes up for that with an interesting town. There's a graveyard with a haunted house, a lighthouse, a dance club and of course the typical amenities like a gym, library, stadium and movie theater. What's really great is the variety of houses you can move your family into. The town seems fairly populated considering each household can only accommodate two Sims, so it's fun to wander about and meet new folks. It is only one city though, so if you plan on playing multiple games it can get boring once you've already met everyone.\nVerdict\nThe Sims 3 on the DS finally delivers an open-world god-sim experience, but it’s not without some minor frustrations. Karma powers don’t work nearly as well on the handheld as they do on consoles, but if you look at it as a bonus feature rather than an integral piece of the gameplay, it’s not a huge deal. If you’re looking for your Sims fix on the go, the third time is clearly the charm.",

    "title": "Halo: Combat Evolved",
    "review": "Unless you've been living under a rock for the last two years, you've already heard about Halo: Combat Evolved. Easily one of the best launch titles for any console and still one of the best games available for the Xbox, it's a game that transcended the market. Though it hasn't quite enjoyed the same visibility in the public consciousness as titles like Grand Theft Auto or The Sims, Halo is, nevertheless, one of the industry's premiere titles. As we said in our Xbox review, it's the excuse to buy an Xbox and vice versa.\n\nSo there are a few ways to approach the review of Halo: Combat Evolved. One is as a fan of the Xbox version; another is as a player completely unaware that the game even existed. I'll try to straddle the fence as best I can in the review but, just so my bias is out in the open right away, I'll tell you that I'm a definite fan of the Xbox version of the game. To further bare my soul, I suppose I should also tell you that I've been excited about this game since it was first demoed to us four years ago (as a PC-only Tribes-killer, no less).\n\nGearbox's conversion (which is a nicer word than \"port\") preserves much of what I loved about the original game. The pacing, the weapons, the enemies and, in fact, the entire content of the game, is exactly as it was when we played it a couple of years ago. That, as you'll see later in the review, is both a blessing and a curse for the PC version of Halo: Combat Evolved.\n\nMost video game science-fiction is of fairly low quality and, thankfully, Halo is the exception to the rule. Boasting a story that draws the player in to an alien world, Halo presents us with enough information and background to keep things interesting while still allowing for real surprises. The player steps into the shoes of an elite soldier just as his ship is attacked by an alien force known as the Covenant. The player is forced to crash land on an alien ring world and uncover the secret of its purpose. Suffice it to say that the whole style and presentation of the story is good enough to stand on its own -- a quality few game plots possess.\n\nAlong the way you'll meet a range of enemies who all exhibit very distinct behaviors. The basic grunt units of the Covenant are small, chicken-like aliens who rely on numbers to overwhelm the player. You can even intimidate these tiny guys by taking out the large enemies first. Left alone on the battlefield, these grunts will scurry off to gather their courage before attacking you again. The shield-carrying Jackals are next on the list and their forward-facing protection and tendency to roll from side-to-side while dodging your fire forces you to adopt entirely different tactics when facing them. The big Elite troopers (in a variety of colors, no less) begin to offer more of a challenge as they're protected by armor and capable of beating the crap out of you if you get too close. There are a few more enemies beyond these guys that have their own tactics and weaknesses.\n\nVideo Review Available!\nThey say seeing is believing. Check out our six-minute video review!\n\nAnd if you have the game and want expert tips at being Halo champ, check out our amazing, in-depth guide.\nLinks :: Video Review\n|\n\nPart of the fun of\nHalo\nis that you won't be able to carry more than two weapons at any one time. Not only does this seem much more reasonable (I love how my character in\nJedi Academy\ncan perform all manner of flips and acrobatics while weighted down with one of every weapon in the galaxy), it also forces the player to focus on tactics by fitting various weapons to varied circumstances.\n\nOne small problem with the weapons (and the enemies, too, I suppose) is that the game still seems balanced for console play. Now, before you get your flame pens ready, let me assure you that I think\nHalo\nworks wonderfully on the Xbox. But regardless of platform allegiance, you have to admit that it's much easier to hit enemies using the mouse aiming system than it is when using the Xbox's right analog stick. But since weapon strength and enemy resistance seem identical on both versions, you'll need to raise the difficulty level on the PC version to get a sufficient challenge.\n\nAnd you may need to lower the graphics settings on the PC version to get a sufficient framerate. While the Xbox version had the occasional stutter here and there, the PC version seems much less reliable. We've tested the game on a range of systems. The one I've used the most is a 2.4GHz machine with a GeForce 4. At that level, I was able to play with all the details up at 800x600 fairly smoothly. I can get comparable performance at slightly higher resolutions by dropping the texture detail and shadows. But with everything turned all the way up at 1600x1200, we still had noticeable (but not completely aggravating) choppiness on our dual 3GHz machines with the new GeForce and Radeon cards.\n\nIf you\ncan\nrun it at the higher end of the graphics, you're in for a real treat. The details apparent on the weapons, soldiers and even rocks and trees leaves little to be desired. Combine that with a fantastically natural suite of animations and you've got a game that draws you in and refuses to let go. Human grenades leave pockmarks on the ground after exploding in a puff of smoke and flame. Better still are the glowing Covenant plasma grenades which explode with an eerie blue light. There's something...I don't know, juicy about it all.\n\nWhile we're on the subject, the weapon sounds are remarkably satisfying and the aspect of the Xbox version's design that translates most easily to the PC format. In the case of the grenades, the explosions are quite deep and the boom will rattle your windows as surely as it rattles your nerves. In fact, all the weapon sounds have a satisfying depth and distinction to them. Voice acting is quite good as well, particularly in the case of the ersatz alien voices used for the Covenant. Beyond that, the game has one of the best game themes around and definitely comparable to the\nBattlefield\ntheme in terms of evoking a Pavlovian salivation here at the office. The rest of the score is just as good, fitting the pace and place of the game perfectly.\n\nThe art style of the game is also perfectly appropriate and not really like anything else I've ever seen. You get a real sense that you're in an alien world and that things have been designed without any human-based preconceptions. Oh, sure, the aliens still walk on legs (and even speak English strangely) but their overall design is great. The same is true of the levels in the game, both those of ship and base interiors and those of broad outdoor areas.\n\n\nBut though the levels are beautiful, there are two main problems with the shape of the levels in Halo. Of the two, the lack of any contextual cohesiveness is probably the more nit-picky. Nevertheless, the endless succession of hallways and rooms fails to fit in to a solid enough framework to give the player a real sense of place. In other words, nearly all of the rooms in Halo have no excuse for existing beyond offering a convenient place for you to fight a new batch of enemies.\n\n\nFrequent repetition of spaces is the worse offender in terms of the game's level design. You'll find yourself traveling through long chains of rooms that all look exactly alike. This is particularly true for the final half of the game where it seems as if the entire environment is made up of three modular pieces: long halls, circular rooms or large bridges. There's only so much variety you can obtain from using these pieces again and again and, while it gives the player a chance to try different approaches to similar situations, it can easily become monotonous.\n\nIt can also make it damned difficult to tell one room from another during the rare cases where you get turned around or are forced to backtrack through other areas. Fortunately, Halo makes use of small lighted triangles placed on the floor that indicate which direction you should be heading. These are a bit of a contrived convenience but they definitely help keep you oriented through the game's more repetitive areas.\n\nIt's too bad that the repetition of areas tends to kill the pace of the game somewhat, particularly because, outside of that single frustration, Halo has probably a much better overall sense of rhythm than most shooters on the market. It starts big with the initial alien attacks on the Pillar of Autumn and it really doesn't ever let up. The few rare moments when you're not blasting away at throngs of enemy aliens, you'll be watching some fantastic cutscenes that help bring you back to the plot. Your marine's power suit also carries the personality of the ship's AI and she'll provide lots of advice and instructions to you within the game itself, thereby keeping the action wonderfully immediate.\n\nThere are also some really fantastic triggers in the game. During certain transitions, the screen will shrink to the more familiar letterbox format as events are played out before you within the game engine. Things like chapter titles and varying music cues help clue you in that something new is about to happen and provide you with a clear framework for the overall shape of the game. As with the physics, it's a slightly inexpressible quality that makes it all work so well. Let's just say that ten minutes of playing through it is worth a thousand words of explanation as to why it works.\n\nI can, at least, offer one concrete example of how this design works. The game has automatically saves your progress at frequent checkpoints. Though you can have multiple save files now, you'll rarely (if ever) bother to save your game yourself. Now that I think about it, I finished the PC game without saving once, preferring to remain \"in the moment\" and let the game engine take care of backing up your progress. When (notice I didn't say \"if\") you die, the game automatically reloads the last checkpoint for you. I should also mention here that there are virtually no load times in the game at all. Transitioning between levels on the Xbox version could take up to half a minute in some cases. Here it's virtually instantaneous.\n\nThough it's equally hard to quantify, I have to say that Halo has one of the best physics systems around. Though it's nearly impossible to express in words, the experience of playing Halo convinces you that you're in a world with consistent and intuitive natural laws. Everything has an appreciable mass and you'll get a real sense of the weight of objects as you interact with them. Toss a grenade in to a clump of enemies and you'll see them blown through the air by the blast. As they twist and tumble and eventually slam in to the ground you'll have no doubt that these guys actually weigh something in the environment.\n\n\nThis impression of mass is also strong with the game's vehicles, particularly the Warthog. This wheeled jeep has offered us countless hours of driving fun. It ranks right up there with the jeep from Battlefield in terms of believable behavior. Hit a small slope and the jeep will lift off the ground and settle back down quite naturally. The effect of the suspension goes a long way to making things look more realistic, but the sense of weight applies even to the game's flying vehicles.\n\n\nWhile many Xboxers enjoyed playing through the game cooperatively with a friend, no such feature is offered on the PC version. I tend to be a bit more forgiving of this omission than some of the other editors around here, but it's still unfortunate that PC players won't have the same chance to take on the entire game alongside a buddy. Gearbox's explanation that the code required to include this feature would involve a substantial overhaul seems a sufficient enough reason to go ahead and release the title without it.\n\nBut as a consolation, they have added six new maps and a couple of new weapons and modes. The more directed Assault mode (which alternates in placing two teams on defense and offense in a CTF format) is a nice addition, but those players who want more can use the game's custom multiplayer mode to create their own versions of the game, including game type, vehicle mix and a few other options. The team has also allowed gamers to pilot the flying Covenant Banshee in multiplayer. Those of you who've managed to snag this baby during the single player game will relish the thought of swooping down on your enemies from above and laying them out with the craft's formidable weaponry.\n\nThe six new maps offer a range of interesting spaces in which to play. I quite like the level based on the beach assault during the single player game's Silent Cartographer level. Conversely, the large bridge level offers something that we haven't really seen before but it still quite compelling. Given the game's 16-player limit, we won't find fault with the relative intimacy of some of the levels. But even on the smaller levels, there are interesting and hidden routes you can take to seemingly inaccessible areas.\n\n\nThe networking code seems stable enough but the single player game's occasionally choppy performance occurs here as well, particularly when you've got a full roster of players all tossing grenades about. Since the game's not due out till next week, we've had to content ourselves with LAN games here at the office and the occasional online match against industry-insider types who already have their gold versions. Once more players start flooding the servers, Gearbox will have an opportunity to address some of the network performance issues. Hopefully, they'll be able to do the same to the game's overall graphics performance.\nVerdict\nI loved this game on the Xbox and it's one of the titles I'll still bust out from time to time, particularly for its split-screen multiplayer appeal. But when evaluated against the standards of the current PC shooter catalog, Halo seems to fall short in just a few key areas: repetitive levels, steep performance requirements and a lingering console balance.\nGiven the fact that so little has changed in the game's transition to the PC, I certainly won't recommend it to the considerably large group of players who are already satisfied with the Xbox version. Sure, you get a few new things in the area of multiplayer but the rest of the game is exactly as it was two years ago. If you've played the game on the Xbox, there's not much for you here. But if you're in the 2 to 3GHz range and have a good 3D accelerator, then the PC version will definitely reward your investment, both in time and in the money you spent to get a powerful computer.",

    "title": "World of Warcraft",
    "review": "MMOs are a strange beast. They are designed to make you play as much as possible, yet addictiveness does not always equal fun. In the field of pyschology, there are several kinds of rewards systems, and the one that seems to be the most successful is the random reward introduced at a random time. Sometimes you click the button, and nothing happens. Sometimes you click and get the food pellet. It's this mechanism that fuels the slots in Vegas, and when you walk away empty, as is statistically inevitable over a long enough stretch of time, you tell yourself that the overall value was the experience itself, since you come away with nothing tangible. MMOs take away your time and they never deliver a discreet conclusion.\nI played a ton of Dark Age of Camelot shortly after it launched, and I find myself reminded of it negatively every day that I play World of Warcraft. To discuss the differences in favor of WoW would be an article in itself, but I'll try to keep to the main points.\nFirst, let's talk about The Grind. In a traditional persistent online RPG, you advance your character by killing an endless string of monsters, and by doing \"FedEx\" quests where you get some money and/or experience points by delivering an arbitrary item from Point A to Point B. As your character advances, his or her progress begins to slow. It takes longer and longer to get to the next level, because you need more and more experience points each time, yet the experience returned from monsters and deliveries does not scale accordingly. Yet you feel compelled to continue because at Level X you get a really cool spell or other ability that's supposed to make the game more \"fun.\"\nThe second part of the grind is \"downtime,\" the amount of time it takes to recover from each monster (or \"mob\") encounter. When I played DAOC, it typically took every ounce of my resources to defeat an enemy that would give me respectable experience. Then I would sit down and wait while my energy bars slowly refilled. Then you'd have to wait awhile for the next batch of monsters to spawn again, and you'd typically be competing against other players and \"camping\" this same spot all day long.\nNow, imagine an MMO where your experience is a string of quests where you're rewarded with a cool item, recipe, or a decent amount of pocket money. A game where the grind is virtually eliminated--a game where downtime is relatively nonexistent, where enemies respawn rapidly and dynamically according to how many players are in the local area; where you can use a healing spell, or bandage yourself, or eat some food, or all three, before diving right back in again. Your character's death doesn't result in the loss of many hours of experience points, or one of your items, or any money (although there is item decay, so whatever you have equipped currently takes a 10% durability hit). When you die, you resurrect as a ghost who moves quickly, runs on water, and cannot be harmed on its way back to its body. You can also have a player resurrect you in a matter of moments, even after you have entered ghost form. This is a game that understands Fun.\nWelcome to World of Warcraft.\nWoW has been described widely as a \"newbie-friendly\" game, but after playing since the closed beta phase that started back in Spring of this year, I can honestly say that WoW is friendly to everybody. Everything from the colorful art style to the endearing player animations, to the countless quirks of personality makes WoW an inviting experience. Blizzard's passion for gaming joy is infectious, and its sense of humor disarming.\nLet's talk about the geography for a moment. The world of Azeroth is split into two continents: the actual continent of Azeroth (confusing, I know) and Kalimdor, where the Orcs, Trolls and Tauren live. The Night Elves, members of the Alliance, are stuck over there, just as the Undead, member of the Horde, are stuck in Azeroth with the goody-goody humans, dwarves and gnomes. Travel in between the continents is done by Zeppelin for the Horde, and by boat for the Alliance. The bus will come along every few minutes, and it only takes a few minutes to get across. You can also fly in between cities, and there's a free and very quick underground train between Stormwind, the human capital, and Ironforge, the dwarf capital. Both continents are broken into many zones of increasing difficulty as you go farther and farther from your faction's seat of power. At around level 30, halfway to the current cap, you'll start entering zones where each faction has quests. Some of these quests are \"instanced,\" meaning your group gets loaded into an \"instance\" of the zone that won't contain any other players. This is quite handy in those contested zones, and in areas where you'll be competing for mobs and key quest requirements.\nAnd it's the quests that weave the experience together, from the moment you first step into the world. They act as an excellent introduction to the game and are designed to guide you smoothly from zone to zone. The starting zone has mobs around level 1-10, the second zone is 10-20, and you should have quests the whole way through. Are these quests uniformly exciting? No. There are three types: kill quests, collection quests, and a few delivery quests (which are almost always used to introduce you to new areas, instead of making you run the same route back and forth, or sending you through dangerous territory, or being ridiculously long just to pad the amount of time you spend sitting in front of the computer, playing the game).\nThe kill quests aren't that bad. Yes, you could argue that this is nothing more than grinding with a twist, but the experience boost you get from completing them, and the concrete rewards you earn when successful, and the camaraderie you can develop with your fellow players in the meantime, ends the monotony and the vague sense of spiteful condescension on the designer's part. When you group up for one of these, everyone gets credit each time a mob is taken down. This is good, and it goes by pretty quickly as long as your buddies keep their heads and don't get too risky.\nThe collection quests, however, can be a bear. I like WoW a lot, but the frequency with which the quest items drop is pretty low. Say you need ten wolf ears or whanot--it could take thirty wolves before all ten of those ears drop, even though you should theoretically be able to rip the suckers right off, stick them in your pocket, and be on your way. And when you party up for these, the drop only occurs for one person at a time, unless you select the Need Before Greed loot mode. It can take a long time to collect certain items, to the point where you start feeling a little cheated and toyed with. It's rare, but it stings me every time.\nThere are several loot modes, which is excellent, but none quite prevent the problem of simple greed, even NBG. There's the default \"Uncommon\" mode, where all players can roll in-game dice to get the uncommon item, but there's no way to filter out certain character classes, so you have a warrior rolling for a mage staff, simply because they want to sell it or because a friend might need it. WoW does a respectable job of trying to make sure everyone gets a fair distribution of valuable monster drops, and they've made massive improvements to the system over the course of the beta phase, but it looks like there's a little more work that needs to be done, like an option window for the group leader that gives him or her some advanced filtering abilities. I'd also like to be able to have more than five people in a party, but then again, there are many quests where you can never have enough people.\nWhat's more is how the quests are introduced. In the town you fly into, there will be people standing around with yellow exclamation marks above their heads. If it's gray, that means you're not high enough level to do it. When you accept the quest, it turns into a gray question mark that turns yellow when you've satisfied all the requirements. There's very little hunting around for someone who's name you've been given by another NPC, or just hunting around for anything to do.\nWith the instanced quests, though, WoW isn't quite so newb-friendly, frankly. It can take hours to finish some of these, and a lot of people just don't have that much time to sit down and play. As your character progresses, you'll be introduced to more and more involved adventures, some of which take you into territory controlled by the enemy faction, which is frustrating on the player-versus-player (PvP) servers. In PvP, the zones are green, yellow and red. In a green zone, the enemy can't attack you until you attack them. In a yellow zone, it's anybody's party. So when you go into someone else's green zone, you'll be unable to proactively clear a path to your destination. You also can't communicate to the other faction in the general chat window, and the game has built-in language differences that translate your words into gibbering (although the assumption is that you'll eventually be able to learn the languages of other races). So you can't just tell the locals that you come in peace and won't be staying long.\nAnd since they have no particular reason to trust you anyway, it's a pretty risky endeavor for a Paladin to head to Silverpine to get one of the items for Verigan's Fist, a very powerful mace accessible to this player class at level 20--provided they gather all the ingredients. During beta, I took my level 20 Undead warlock into the Wetlands, the third-tier Alliance zone (levels 20-30). Since PvP wasn't implemented at that point, all I had to worry about were the hostile non-player characters wandering around, and the challenging monsters blanketing the zone. Adding hostile players would have made it nigh-impossible to do solo, and there isn't a lot of incentive for people to party with you and go out all that way, since they're not getting any quest reward for it. Perhaps Blizzard could introduce side rewards for party members who help someone complete one of these large quests, but cap the reward with diminishing returns to prevent guilds from powering their low-level members through the mission all day.\nAlthough Verigan's Fist is a drool-worthy weapon, it's not necessary in the way that the warlock's Succubus is. The creatures he or she can summon are part and parcel of the class--an extension of their list of spells. The warlock can't \"tank\" like a melee fighter--he can't just sit their and soak up damage, so he needs someone to keep the enemy distracted from him while he whales away with powerful spells. He does a better job here than the mage can, but he needs a minion to add the extra damage that a mage can do on his or her own.\nStill, when you put it in perspective, these issues beat the heck out of swinging at the same dumb mobs all day. It beats taking several minutes to recoup from each fight and wait for another mob to appear. Several minutes might not seem like a lot, but when most players do the MMO thing for several hours a day, those minutes add up fast. Since the retail release, I've spent around 100 hours of play leveling my warrior up to 30, and I spent a few more hours testing out a mage on both the Alliance and Horde sides. (My warrior is a member of the I Got Nuggets guild, created by the IGN editorial team and consisting of a few of us and the Insider members that play the game and asked to join up with us.) That's a lot of time that usually spent running or sitting down, but the quick, inexpensive and extensive transportation system and the tools to eliminate downtime pack so much content into the experience that it puts the genre in the shade. DAOC was, when I played it, more of a graphical chat room than a game, because of all the time spent not actually playing. This may make for a strong community, but what's the reward when it's a community of people sitting and running in between the actual content phases?\nOn the other hand, to be fair, the amount of action in WoW makes it relatively difficult to communicate and plan effectively. Many players resort to chat macros to say, \"Hey, I'm being attacked, I need help,\" or, \"I'm going to cast a spell on this mob that will remove it from combat, so please don't attack it and thereby pull it back in.\" WoW could use a more robust voice macro system for when things get hairy. And with the dynamic spawning system, things can get hairy indeed. It's definitely the lesser of two evils, the other being waiting for the mobs to appear when they're good an ready, but it still needs work, as there will be times when they just keep coming and coming until the whole party's been wiped out.\nHowever, the instanced dungeons are a different story, and there are some simply eye-popping set pieces, like the final stage of the Deadmines in Westfall. There's a bunch of screenshots of that in the gallery, as well as many other images I've taken over the past several months I've been playing.\nAnd here's where I talk about the graphics. World of Warcraft is not cutting-edge in this department, but the artistic direction is top-notch. Take the Undercity, for example, the Undead capital beneath the ruins of the former human city of Lordaeron. It's like Beetlejuice meets A Nightmare Before Christmas, with fanciful shapes, bright colors, and lots of endearingly silly touches of spookiness. Then there's Orgrimmar, the Orc capital, with its mesas that look almost painted by hand, with the layers of soil and soil streaking and banding like streams of water. Or perhaps Ironforge, the massive city built into a mountain and featuring a central forge large enough to house a football stadium, with lava pouring from the ceiling and giant gears churning all day long. You can also use the countless braziers to cook food, which is one of the equally countless touches that makes WoW so friendly. Then there's Darnassus, with the Ancients (like Ents, but much larger), slowly wandering the city with booming footsteps.\nStill, the relatively low number of polygons will not help WoW in the long run, as strong as the art style is. People's hands are particularly blocky, and each gender has one body type, making a mage as beefy as a warrior, which looks a little silly. You can make an argument for a barrel-chested Merlin making the player feel heroic, but I would like more options for character customization. The other big MMOs offer an order of magnitude more here, and the lack of differentiation makes people look a little too similar to one another. Variety is a good thing, especially when you put so much play time into the game and see countless other players in a single session.\nThankfully, the environments do not suffer this, and they also transition smoothly, with no loading times. Yes, you read that right. Entering the underground train puts you in an instance, but flying from one end of the continent to another will not require staring dully at a single progress bar as it inches painfully from one side to the other. The game also starts up impressively fast, probably thanks to the low complexity of the objects and character models. Like I said before, there's not a lot of waiting around in this game. At any rate, each zone has a distinct character, almost as if a completely different art team worked on each one, and they may have. At the same time, the transitions are never jarring. As you fly from, say, Ironforge to the Wetlands, you'll descend down a snowy mountain, gradually making your way down to the green and brown marshes full of crocolisks (six-legged crocodiles), gnolls, and many other beasties. You can still definitely sense when you're moving into a new area, so they must have done a lot of work on getting this balance just right.\nI also had the mouse pointer lock up a few times, about ten seconds into the session, and it's reportedly related to how the game deals with nVidia's mouse acceleration on 6800 cards. You can use software mode, but it's a little sluggish. I found that if I just spun the pointer around until I felt I was clear, I didn't have any issues. The 9800 Pro on my work rig did not have this issue.\nLast but not least is the full-screen bloom effect. While it gives the game a warm glow, it also makes textures blurry, removes antialiasing, and makes the names above people's heads difficult to read from a distance. I found that *not* using bloom made things sharper and more vivid. If you like it, then more power to you, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.\nSound is also a large part of the WoW experience, and they've done an excellent job with the score--the music just doesn't get old. It's apparently just subliminal enough to withstand hundreds of hours of play. Each zone has its own distinct theme, whether it's the sad strings in Westfall, the tribal sounds of Stonetalon, or the slow dreaminess of Ashenvale. You can also disable music and play your own stuff in the background, as WoW cooperates very well with the ALT+TAB and CTRL+ESC command. Running in the background, WoW usually takes up 70-90MB of RAM, so you can quickly pop onto the forums or check out thottbot.com if you need a quick answer to a tough question. When the queues were bad at launch, I just let WoW sit in the taskbar while I checked out the latest forum topics. On a side note, you can quit the game immediately, instead of having to wait on the traditional 20-30 second timer, unless you're in combat.\nAnd not only is Azeroth an interesting place to explore, it's pretty easy to go about things under your own steam. You see, the usual MMO model is that you pretty much have to group up in order to continue at a reasonable pace, because the mobs that give reasonable experience start getting really tough, and eventually they're impossible to fight alone. This is not the case in World of Warcraft, although there are many \"elite\" quests where you really can't go alone. Still, you can spend most of your time just puttering around, beating on bad guys, getting cool loot, improving your trade skills, and trading at the auction house. It's actually a pretty pleasant way to while away some gaming hours.\nWhat's also cool is that each player gets a \"hearthstone,\" for free, which allows them to bind themselves to a large town or city and teleport back there once every 60 minutes. I'm bound to Ironforge, where the Alliance auction house is. The underground train and the flight paths make it a quick trip back to anywhere on the continent--no more than ten minutes, unless you're heading out to the fringes. And the Mage can teleport to the capital cities under his own power starting at level 20, which can take as little as one weekend to reach, if you're serious about reaching that goal. At higher levels, he can even open portals to certain cities that his or her party members can use for a quick trip back home. Similarly, the Warlock can eventually summon a fellow player from anywhere in the world. Getting to where you need to be never takes a long time in WoW.\nNow, I have to say that the player classes are not perfectly balanced, and each one went through significant changes over the course of development and will very likely continue to evolve. You long-time MMO players will be familiar with the \"holy trinity\"--mage, priest, fighter--and the same pretty much holds true here. A mix of those is pretty much all you need for any given group quest, and the poor Rogue is the one who often gets left out in the cold, to the point of general party invitations informing rogues in the vicinity sometimes that they need not apply.\nYou see, the rogue dishes a lot of damage in a short amount of time, but he or she can only wear leather armor at most, so he also gets a lot of pain dished back, making him the focus of the priest's attention. At the same time, his skills don't include much \"aggro hold,\" meaning he can't keep attention away from the priest who's healing him, or the mage in the back who's also dishing a lot of damage. So he ends up complicating things a lot, and many players would rather do without the complication. The rogue can knock out an enemy, but this ability has to be used before combat has begun, and it can be resisted, and he has to creep up slowly to the mob. And the mob may be close enough to a buddy so that sapping in general will get their attention.\nThe other classes, like the warlock, hunter, and paladin, do all right here, because they can fill in the gaps in the trinity. The paladin is a hybrid class, since he's a fighter with some healing, buffing, and protection abilities, and he's usually next in line to the trinity. Paladins are always welcome, since they can boost people's stats on an individual basis and cast a single aura the whole group benefits from and that doesn't expire like the buffs do. The warrior doesn't do as well as he used to, since his Charge ability, which allows him to rapidly close the gap and stun a mob, can no longer be used after the combat phase has begun. He also no longer has the Pummel ability, a close-range attack that allowed a warrior without a shield to stun a mob.\nNow, you pretty much have to have a shield to fight a spellcaster, a situation where stunning them (and thereby canceling the spell cast) a matter of life and death for the whole group. Having a shield gives him or her more armor, but it also means less damage, since you're only using a one-handed weapon. The warrior also misses a significant amount of time, which is frustrating since he needs to land a hit in order to generate Rage (their version of mana) and use all of his special attacks. To top it off, his only way to generate Rage without fighting uses up 100 points of health, which used to not be the case. He needs some love.\nThe warrior is also a gear-dependent class, since he gets hit a lot, basically, and needs all the boosted stats he can get to stay alive and be effective. I had to take up the Mining profession and stop often to pick up ore from the nodes placed throughout the zone, just so I could turn around and sell it at the auction house and pay for new armor and weapons. Being in a guild helps, but someone still has to go around and make a lot of money to keep him nice and shiny. Thankfully, the auction house is intuitive, and it uses the in-game mail system to deliver your goods the minute a successful auction has gone through. You can mail items and money to other players within your faction, with an attached note, and it takes about an hour to arrive, and you can grab your package from any of the mailboxes scattered throughout the world. And you even get a new mail notification in the interface. It's really a great system.\nAt the auction house, you get an estimation of how much longer the auction will last, who's selling it, a pop-up describing the item in detail, and the seller can set an instant buyout price (which has to be at least the cost of the item). You just click-and-drag the item from your bags to the auction interface, and the game sets a basic price for it, which works out to twice what a vendor would pay you for it. You can set this number to anything you like, and you will see some outlandish prices set by people who really have no clue, or just have no space left in their inventory or at the bank, but prices are generally competitive. Since a mob will almost never drop an item equaling the level it's at, you'll want to stop at the auction house from time to time to pick up the best stuff you could get, which is either crafted or obtained by a higher-level player.\nSpeaking of crafting, I have to say that, although it's great that a failed attempt doesn't make you lose materials, and you can now click once to craft multiple items, there is still a definite problem with your character progressing faster than the skill. As your skill increases, it takes progressively more and more material to make a higher-level item, so it takes you longer and longer to gather all the materials when you'd probably rather be out questing. People will offer to make you the item for free, as long as you provide the materials. This way they don't have to gather their own materials and waste them skilling up to what they really want to craft, and you don't need to have the crafting skill to make the item. But if the scaling was just a little gentler (or, dare I say it, the character leveling a little slower), I'd be more inclined to take up crafting.\nAlso, I think it's a bit unfair to the leatherworkers and tailors that their blacksmithing friends can make weapons as well as armor. Blacksmiths can also take up Mining as their other profession and thereby get almost all their materials \"in the field,\" whereas leatherworking requires both Skinning and materials collected with the Mining skill. This wouldn't be so bad if you could do more than two professions at a time (with your skill resetting if you unlearn it and re-learn later on). But to be a Leatherworker requires you to buy stuff. And tailoring recipes will eventually need leather and Mining materials as well.\nDoes this make the economy stronger? Sure, it probably does, but the fun factor is also reduced. I'm still debating which option I'd take. Alchemy and Herbalism go together, but they're both Primary professions, locking you out of trying out other stuff if you want to be able to get your own materials, which most people do. Maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill. But I like fun, and World of Warcraft likes me to have fun, and that fun factor gets a little inconsistent here. It feels too much like work.\nPvP could also use some more fun factor, to be honest. Currently, you don't get any experience, or additional abilities, or money, or items from fighting the other faction or dueling other players, so it ends up feeling tacked on. They have plans, which include PvP arenas, but it's pretty undercooked for now. There's also no free-for-all PvP, which is good or bad, depending on your tastes--just an FYI. Personally, I prefer not getting ganked by my fellow players, which happens a lot when a group from the enemy faction comes rolling into town, looking for trouble and averaging ten levels above the players questing in that area.\nVerdict\nWorld of Warcraft, like any MMO, is a tough game to score. Your play experience will have no concrete resolution, and content and character class balancing will make for a slightly different experience from one month to the next. And WoW III had some debilitating issues at launch trying to handle the record-breaking number of people filing in for subscriptions. After having written about the extremely long queues, they have dwindled to almost nothing, even at peak playing times, and the game has become much more stable. I still get the occasional crash, but WoW still has a polish that puts most other MMO launches to shame. Almost a victim of its own popularity, World of Warcraft quickly found its feet, serving up no fewer than eighty-eight servers across the country, with more likely on the way.",

    "title": "Grand Theft Auto V",
    "review": "Note: This review exclusively covers the single-player portion of Grand Theft Auto V, since it launched without any multiplayer mode. Also see our GTA Online Review and GTA 5 Cheats.\nFor me, Grand Theft Auto V’s extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid-game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane, fought the crew, hijacked the thing, and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time, whilst driving around in an off-road buggy, I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path, and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit, where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. “Typical!” one of them yelled at me, as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.\nI could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an abundance of such moments, big and small, that make San Andreas – the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas – feel like a living world where anything can happen. It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly well-realised world and tells a story that’s gripping, thrilling, and darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series, and there’s no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn’t been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. It’s immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the auto-aim less touchy. The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road, though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts. And at long last, Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons, mission checkpointing, ensuring that you never have to do a long, tedious drive six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again.\nGrand Theft Auto V is also an intelligent, wickedly comic, and bitingly relevant commentary on contemporary, post-economic crisis America. Everything about it drips satire: it rips into the Millennial generation, celebrities, the far right, the far left, the middle class, the media... Nothing is safe from Rockstar’s sharp tongue, including modern video games. One prominent supporting character spends most of his time in his room shouting sexual threats at people on a headset whilst playing a first-person shooter called Righteous Slaughter (“Rated PG – pretty much the same as the last game.”) It’s not exactly subtle – he literally has the word “Entitled” tattooed on his neck, and the in-game radio and TV’s outright piss-takes don’t leave much to the imagination – but it is often extremely funny, and sometimes provocative with it. Grand Theft Auto’s San Andreas is a fantasy, but the things it satirises – greed, corruption, hypocrisy, the abuse of power – are all very real. If GTA IV was a targeted assassination of the American dream, GTA V takes aim at the modern American reality. The attention to detail that goes into making its world feel alive and believable is also what makes its satire so biting.\nGrand Theft Auto V’s plot happily operates at the boundaries of plausibility, sending you out to ride dirt bikes along the top of trains, hijack military aircraft, and engage in absurd shootouts with scores of policemen, but its three main characters are what keep it relatable even at its most extreme. The well-written and acted interplay between them provides the biggest laughs and most affecting moments, and the way that their relationships with one another developed and my opinion of them changed throughout the story gave the narrative its power. They feel like people – albeit extraordinarily f***ed-up people.\nMichael is a retired con man in his 40s, filling out around the middle as he drinks beside the pool in his Vinewood mansion with a layabout son, air-headed daughter, serially unfaithful wife, and very expensive therapist – all of whom hate him. Franklin is a young man from downtown Los Santos who laments the gang-banger stereotype even as he’s reluctantly seduced by the prospect of a bigger score. And then there’s Trevor, a volatile career criminal who lives in the desert selling drugs and murdering rednecks; a psychopath whose bloodthirsty lunacy is fuelled by a combination of methamphetamine and a seriously messed-up childhood.\nThe missions flit between their individual stories and an overarching plotline that involves all three, and it’s a credit to GTA V’s versatility and universal quality that each character has his share of standout missions. As their arcs developed I felt very differently about each of them at different times – they’re not entirely the archetypes that they seem to be.\nThis three-character structure makes for excellent pacing and great variety in the storyline, but it also allows Rockstar to compartmentalise different aspects of Grand Theft Auto’s personality. In doing so, it sidesteps some of the troubling disconnect that arose when Niko Bellic abruptly alternated between anti-violent philosophising and sociopathic killing sprees in GTA IV. Here, many of Michael’s missions revolve around his family and his past, Franklin is usually on call for vehicular mayhem, and extreme murderous rampages are left to Trevor. Each has a special ability suited to his skills – Franklin can to slow time while driving, for example – which gives them a unique touch. Narratively, it’s effective – even off-mission I found myself playing in character, acting like a mid-life-crisis guy with anger issues as Michael, a thrill-seeker as Franklin, and a maniac as Trevor. The first thing I did when Franklin finally made some good money was buy him an awesome car, because I felt like that’s what he’d want.\nTrevor feels a like a bit of a get-out-of-jail-free card for Rockstar, providing an outlet for all the preposterous antics and murderous behaviour that otherwise might not fit in with GTA V’s narrative ambitions. I found his violent insanity a little overblown and tiresome at first. As get-out clauses go, though, it’s pretty effective, and Trevor’s over-the-top missions are some of GTA V’s action-packed highlights. It’s a successful way of solving a problem that’s prevalent in open-world games: the tension between the story that the writers are trying to tell, and the story you create yourself within its systems and its world. Grand Theft Auto V accommodates both, masterfully, allowing neither to undermine the other.\nThe actual act of switching between them also provides a window into their individual lives and habits, fleshing out their personalities in a way that feels natural and novel. Pick a character and the camera zooms out over the San Andreas map, closing back in on wherever they happen to be. Michael might be at home watching TV when you drop in on him, or speeding along the motorway blasting ‘80s hits, or having a cigarette at the golf club; Franklin might be walking out of a strip club, munching a bag of snacks at home, or arguing with his ex-girlfriend; there’s a good chance that Trevor could be passed out half naked on a beach surrounded by dead bodies or, on one memorable occasion, drunk in a stolen police helicopter.\nIt could be nearly anything, because there is a bewildering multiplicity of things to do in the new San Andreas – tennis, yoga, hiking, racing on sea and on land, flying planes, golfing, cycling, diving, hunting, and more. The missions are an able guide to both San Andreas’ locations and its activities, touring you around the map and whetting your appetite for independent exploration of it all. The way that we’re introduced to San Andreas never feels artificial – the map is completely open from the start, for example – which contributes to the impression that it’s a real place, somewhere you can get to know. If GTA IV’s Liberty City feels like a living city, San Andreas feels like a living world. I saw people walking their dogs along the beach in the country as I jet-skied past, arguing on the street outside a cinema in Los Santos, and camped – with tents and everything – overnight on Mount Chiliad, before packing up and continuing a hike in the morning. It’s astounding.\nThe ambience changes dramatically depending on where you are, too. Trevor’s dusty trailer out in the middle of nowhere in Blaine County feels like a different world from downtown Los Santos or Vespucci Beach. It wasn’t until the first time I flew a plane out of the city and over the mountains I was cycling around a few hours before that the full scale of it became obvious. It pushes the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 further than it has any right to, and it looks incredible. The biggest jump in quality since Grand Theft Auto IV is the character animation, but the world is also much more expansive, detailed, and populous. The price we pay for that is occasional framerate dips and texture pop-in, which I found became more prominent the longer I played, but never significantly detracted from my experience. For such a gigantic and flexible world it’s also remarkably bug-free – I encountered just three minor issues in the 35 hours I spent on my first playthrough, none of which caused me to fail a mission.\nSan Andreas’s extraordinary sense of place is heightened by the fact that so much of it isn’t on the map. There’s so much going on that it’s easy to find things organically, rather than spend your life following a mission marker. I once stole a passenger jet from the airport for the hell of it, then parachuted onto the top of the tallest building in Los Santos. (I then accidentally jumped off the top and fell to my death, forgetting that I’d already used the parachute, but I usually leave that bit out.) Out driving in the country, I came across a man tied to a telephone pole in womens’ underwear. I chased down criminals who randomly swipe purses on the street, and happened across gunbattles between police and other miscreants, events that add a sense that this world isn’t completely uneventful if I wasn’t here to disrupt normalcy. I bought an expensive mountain bike and cycled around in the hills, enjoying the view. These little moments can be captured on your phone camera – which, brilliantly, can also take selfies. I have several snaps of Trevor doing his unhinged version of a smile in his underpants on top of a mountain.\nThe story that GTA V tells through its missions takes full advantage of all this variety beyond driving and shooting (though the driving and shooting is still supremely enjoyable). It’s got so many great moments. It had me racing Michael’s lazy blob of a son across Vespucci Beach in one of many misguided attempts at father-son bonding, using a thermal scope to search for someone from a helicopter before chasing them across the city on the ground, torching a meth lab, towing cars for Franklin’s crack-addict cousin to prevent him from losing his job, infiltrating a facility from the sea in a wetsuit and flippers, piloting a submarine, impersonating a construction worker, doing yoga, escaping on jet skis, failing multiple times to land a plane loaded with drugs at a hangar out in the desert… it goes on and on. The days of a repetitive series of “drive here, find this guy, shoot this guy” are behind us. Even missions that would otherwise be formulaic are imbued with novelty and excitement by the potential to play them from three different viewpoints – in a shootout, Trevor might be firing RPGs from a rooftop as Michael and Franklin flank the enemy on the ground.\nIt’s the heists – multi-stage, huge-scale events that serve as the story’s climactic peaks – that show Grand Theft Auto V at its most ambitious and accomplished. Usually there’s a choice between a more involved, stealthier option that will (hopefully) attract less heat, and an all-out option that will be less tense but more explosively chaotic – and what crew to take along with you on the job. All of GTA V’s missions are replayable at any time, letting you relive favourite moments or try out another approach. They also have optional objectives in the vein of Assassin’s Creed’s synchronisation challenges, but crucially, these are invisible the first time you play a mission, and so they don’t distract you from doing things your own way.\nSometimes your own way won’t be the way that the designers expected you to do something, and though Grand Theft Auto V is usually very good at bending around you when that happens, there were one or two occasions where it wasn’t prepared for my personal brand of chaos. Overtake a car you’re not supposed to overtake and it will zip through lines of traffic as if by magic. Despite the introduction of new stealth mechanics, enemies will miraculously see you when the mission dictates that they should. Kill someone before you’re supposed to, and that’s sometimes Mission Failed. Most of the time the scripting is good enough to be invisible, but when it’s not, you really notice it – if only because most of the time it’s so seamless.\nAs ever, some of the wittiest writing shows up on the in-game radio that plays behind all of the exploration and mayhem. “There’s nothing more successful, more masculine, more American than a big wad of cash,” blasts one of the in-game ads. “We know times are tough, but they don’t have to be tough for you. Still got some liquidity in your house? Are you insane?” The music selection is also typically excellent, leading to many of those serendipitous moments where you’re driving along and the perfect song comes on. During a heist, when the radio isn’t blaring the background, a dynamic soundtrack seriously builds tension.\nThe satire is helped by integration of modern life into the game world. Every character revolves around their smartphone – it’s used to trade stocks, call up friends to meet up and send emails. There’s a great Facebook spoof, Life Invader, on the in-game Interne, with the slogan “Where Your Personal Information Becomes A Marketing Profile (That We Can Sell)”. You’ll hear adverts for preposterous parodic TV shows that you can actually watch on your TV at home, optionally whilst enjoying a toke. It might not be realistic, but it definitely feels authentic.\nIt’s worth mentioning that when it comes to sex, drugs, and violence, GTA V pushes boundaries much further than ever before. If the morality police were worried about Hot Coffee, there’s a lot here that will provoke moral hysteria. It’s deliciously subversive, and firmly tongue in cheek... but once or twice, it pushes the boundaries of taste, too. There’s one particular scene, a torture scene in which you have no choice but to actively participate, that I found so troubling that I had difficulty playing it; even couched in obvious criticism of the US government’s recourse to torture post 9/11, it’s a shocking moment that will attract justified controversy. It brings to mind Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s No Russian mission, except worse, and without the option to skip over it. Some other stuff, like the ever-present prostitution and extensive strip-club minigames, feels like it’s there just because it can be rather than because it has anything to say.\nThere is nothing in San Andreas, though, that doesn’t serve Rockstar’s purpose in creating an exaggerated projection of America that’s suffused with crime, violence and sleaze. There are no good guys in GTA V. Everyone you meet is a sociopath, narcissist, criminal, lunatic, sadist, cheat, liar, layabout, or some combination of those. Even a man who pays good money to assassinate Los Santos’ worst examples of corporate greed is playing the stock market to his advantage whilst he does it. In a world like this, it’s not hard to see why violence is so often the first recourse. All the pieces fit.\nVerdict\nGrand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It’s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it’s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas. It is one of the very best video games ever made. Note: This review exclusively covers the single-player portion of Grand Theft Auto V, since it launched without any multiplayer mode.

    "title": "Persona 5",
    "review": "In stark contrast to the slow burn of epic-length cutscenes that greet you in previous Persona games, Persona 5 starts its long journey with a bang by throwing you directly into a fast-paced foot chase through a vibrant, stylized Tokyo casino. That’s a bold move, and it’s emblematic of the entire experience. As we’re introduced to the complex yet approachable turn-based battle system in those opening moments, series fans will recognize not only returning systems from Persona 3 and 4, but also long-absent elements like ranged weapons and negotiation that haven’t been in a Persona game in over a decade, adding more depth and variety to combat. Persona 5 is the culmination of everything the JRPG series has been building to, with familiar elements dialed up to 11 and some welcome new surprises added into the mix.\nIn what’s by far the series’ strongest story to date, Persona 5 puts you in the capable shoes of a high school student who spends his evenings saving the world. By day, you’ll attend class, answer quiz questions, and live the life of a typical teenager, but after school you'll see the clever concept of invading the minds of corrupt adults who are up to no good and battling psychological demons in order to change their hearts.\nThese stand-out dungeons take place in “palaces” created within the mind of each target, and Atlus takes advantage of this to set them in diverse and outlandish places. Unlike the procedurally generated halls of Persona 3’s Tartarus or Persona 4’s Midnight Channel, Persona 5’s labyrinths are fully hand-built and feature unique puzzles and mechanics that vary with the theme of each dungeon and never repeat. A museum, for example, has very different security measures than a Medieval castle, and you’ll find very different enemies in a pyramid than you might in a spaceship. Assembling pieces of secret codes to solve a bank vault’s cryptogram or positioning tiles to interpret hieroglyphics feel almost like entirely different games. This gives each palace a sense of identity tied to the target and provides some smart, unpredictable story moments and challenges.\nPersona 5’s sense of scope is staggering compared to Persona 3 or 4.\n“\nPersona 5’s sense of scope is staggering compared to the dungeons in Persona 3 or 4, with palaces easily double or triple the size of those games’ areas. While Persona 4 has you run through linear hallways until you reach the top of a dungeon, Persona 5 has branching paths, networks of hidden rooms, doors that require puzzles to open, and even excursions to other parts of the cognitive world outside of the dungeon itself. Starting each new dungeon is a bit daunting, but solving puzzles and progressing to each new area offers a wonderful sense of accomplishment.\n\nWhile chemistry between the characters never quite reaches the heights of Persona 4’s Scooby Gang vibe, Persona 5’s more cohesive main story does allow each character to shine in individual moments instead, exploring troubled pasts like the loss of a parent to add weight to present day scenarios. This series has never shied away from exploring serious subject matter, and here it shines light on abuse by teachers, drug sales, suicide, and a host of other issues that are handled well and are at times extraordinarily moving. Each character’s motivation for joining you is relatable and unique, and even each palace’s target has believable conviction. An unrepentant drug dealer, for example, reveals an origin that doesn’t necessarily justify his crimes, but fleshes him out into more than just a bad guy caricature.\nBattle in Persona 5 is a familiar turn-based formula, with melee attacks, ranged weapons, and magic attacks based on one of eight elements. A bit like catching Pokemon, you collect Personas that you’ll use to fight, and each has its own unique set of skills as well as its own set of strengths and weaknesses. While each of your party members has one permanent Persona to use, the protagonist has the lone ability to hold multiple Personas at once. This means that you can acquire additional Personas to use as you progress, and collecting multiple Personas with different abilities is a fun way to tailor your play style to the type of combat you prefer. You can also fuse combinations of Personas to create new ones, which allows you to inherit certain skills until you’ve created the Persona that’s right for you.\nSeeing HD versions of long-time enemies like Jack Frost is a treat for longtime fans.\n“\nEnemy designs are varied and colorful, ranging from humanoids that could almost pass as party members to extravagant complicated monsters, and seeing HD versions of enemies like Jack Frost is a treat for those that have been following the franchise for 20 years. Personas themselves also feature a bit of voice acting, which adds a nice extra layer of polish to negotiation during battles.\n\nExploiting enemies’ elemental weaknesses is pretty standard fare (ice is weak to fire, etc.), and swapping between multiple Personas to keep up with the ever-changing vulnerabilities of foes you encounter helps keep combat from becoming too repetitive. The ability to swap between Personas allows you to choose the right element for any given occasion, which becomes important in battles against enemies who are invulnerable to all but one type of attack. As combat becomes more challenging and exploiting enemy weaknesses becomes imperative, smartly using the new Baton Pass ability can allow for devastating chains and exponential damage increases that completely turn the tide in battle. Baton Pass allows you to hand off your turn to another party member after earning an extra battle action by hitting an enemy’s weak point. That gives you the opportunity to chain together multiple passes, adding a new element of strategy to combat. This is a game changer, as you not only have to make sure you have a Persona with the right element to take down an enemy, but also that you’ve selected party members with skills that can keep the chain going.\nPersona Review Scores\nVIEW 14 IMAGES\nOf course, like any good JRPG, Persona 5 needs a place to allow you to grind to higher levels by fighting enemies over and over. While you can’t return to palaces once they’re complete, you can continually return to a (singular) area called Mementos. Mementos is a large, separate dungeon that returns to the format of procedurally generated hallways like in previous Persona games, and new, deeper levels are unlocked as you beat more palaces. It’s a welcome change of pace in that it provides straightforward battles with no puzzles in between, which is a nice break after working through a particularly challenging dungeon. Since you can’t return to palaces, Mementos also serves as a great place to recruit Personas that you may have missed in previous dungeons. Personas you previously encountered will begin to turn up in new layers of Mementos after you’ve beaten the palace where they originally appeared. Combined with the ability to fuse Personas into new combinations, this thankfully prevents any Personas from being truly missable.\nMissions like these were surprisingly moving in some cases, or ended with unexpected humor in others.\n“\nMementos is also home to Persona 5’s side missions, which involve triggering smaller-scale changes of heart in enemies like school bullies or clingy exes in order to receive bonus cash and items. These missions aren’t much more than short vignettes and didn’t really provide deep enough stories to make me care about the minor characters, in most cases. That said, a few stood out as particularly effective, such as a pet lover fighting against animal abuse or workers fed up with the exploitive practices of their boss. Missions like these were surprisingly moving in some cases, or ended with unexpected humor in others. The most elaborate side missions are those that you earn through Confidants, which are party members or other characters who you’ll form relationships with and level up over time. These Confidants will occasionally introduce you to additional tangential characters whose heart you’re required to change in Mementos in order to continue progressing your relationship with that Confidant. These were generally great and helped to reveal a neat twist in the corresponding story, such as a sympathetic person actually being sinister or unexpected connections between characters.\nSocial Climber\nPersona 5 is a solid modern turn-based JRPG first and foremost, but it also quickly becomes a captivating time-management simulator. When you’re not saving the world, your time after school is your own. You’re able to visit hub districts within Tokyo for activities like training at the gym, fishing, working a part-time job, batting practice, seeing a movie, or just heading home to study, play a retro game, or read one of dozens of books. These activities are a gigantic improvement upon the comparatively limited amount of things to do in Persona 4, and a fun way to expand your personal stats like Charm, Guts, or Kindness.\nOn top of social activities, you also have 20 Confidants to spend time with, forging bonds with fellow students or other citizens of Tokyo. As you level up these bonds you’ll earn relevant stat increases and gameplay advantages that are surprisingly robust. Spending time with a speech-giving politician, for example, might help your negotiation skills, while training with an arcade’s light-gun expert helps your expertise in ranged weapons, and a local board game champion will give you new strategies in battle. Balancing Persona 5’s many activities with maintaining these social links (each of which can only be advanced on specific days) is a welcome challenge and will require methodical notetaking for anyone who wants to maximize each day of the calendar.\nPersona 5 gives every decision a fantastic amount of weight.\n“\nConfidants themselves are voiced and come in a wide range of ages, genders, and circumstances, with noteworthy stories for each. I found myself almost as interested in some Confidants’ stories as I was in the main plot, which offers even more incentive for dedicating time to hanging out with those people. As in previous games, many of the Confidants can still advance into intimate relationships at their highest levels, though it was disappointing to see that Persona 5 still doesn’t offer same-sex dating, despite plenty of sexual tension between the protagonist and a few of the male Confidants.\n\nBy offering so many options and only a finite amount of free time, Persona 5 gives every decision a fantastic amount of weight. Choosing to work part-time might give you extra cash to buy better weapons, but it comes at the cost of ranking up a Confidant or increasing your stats. Spending time with a specific Confidant might help you learn a skill that fits your play style, but it means sacrificing learning more about a different character whose story you might be more interested in. Maximizing the skill you’ve been grinding away at or finishing a side story after multiple in-game months of watching it progress are tremendously rewarding experiences, and even lamenting the opportunities you missed adds a unique layer of replayability that makes starting a New Game+ all the more enticing.\nTokyo Jungle\nAside from the dozens of activities available, the very act of exploring Persona 5’s Tokyo is a delight. From city lights at night to crowded subways during your school commute, every part of this world is bursting with vibrant color, and every detail feels meticulously thought out and eerily accurate to real-world Tokyo. The anime-like art style is complemented by full animated cutscenes that are absolutely gorgeous and help to punctuate major story events.\nEach area of Tokyo feels completely distinct, with the major hubs of Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Akihabara each offering aesthetic differences on top of locations reminiscent of their actual real-life counterparts. Shinjuku features a seedy dive bar in contrast to Shibuya’s family-friendly diner, and Akihabara is home to an arcade and shops for buying games and electronics. As the subway-themed map begins to fill in, you get a sense of just how much there is to do in Tokyo compared to Persona 3 and 4’s relatively tiny Tatsumi Port Island and Inaba.\nThe very act of exploring Persona 5’s Tokyo is a delight.\n“\nAll of this is further enhanced by Persona 5’s impressive sense of style. I found myself flicking back and forth in menus over and over simply to appreciate the slick transitions. Sharp design choices permeate even tiny details of gameplay, like scene changes that vary based upon your mode of transportation as you leave each area, or a free-flowing results screen after victory in battle.\n\nIt almost feels strange to highlight since the incredible style is immediately apparent after looking at it for even a few seconds, but I can’t overstate the number of times that I marveled at the gorgeous effects like ambushing an enemy and flowing directly into battle, or went out of my way to explore on a rainy day to appreciate weather effects or small touches like pulling out an umbrella as you leave a building. Persona 5’s dynamic acid jazz-inspired soundtrack also helps to highlight everything from quiet moments to bombastic boss battles, helping to tie together an overall experience that feels truly special.\nVerdict\nPersona 5 is a massive, gorgeous JRPG with well over 100 hours of gameplay for completionists. With more to do than ever and the series’ strongest story to date, it stands out as an extraordinary, memorable experience and easily one of the deepest JRPGs of the last decade. Its sprawling dungeon design and stylish, fully realized world are an absolute joy to explore, and even after three playthroughs and the Platinum trophy, I find myself itching to go back to try different dialogue options with Confidants or revisit particularly fun puzzles. This is a new gold standard for Japanese RPGs and by far the best entry in the series yet.",

    "title": "Bloodborne",
    "review": "There’s incredible power to Bloodborne. It’s not just an amazing dance of dodges and swipes through encounters that often push the limits of reflexes and endurance, it’s a thought-provoking experience that’s wormed its way into my mind and melted my resolve. But through perseverance, patient growth, and determined skill, it’s proved itself an unconventional adventure that ultimately gives much more than it takes – which at times can be a staggering cost. By the end, the only frustrations that don’t turn to triumphs are the technical ones. After more than 60 hours of grappling with its terrors, monsters, and the environment itself, I’m left dumbfounded by Bloodborne’s capability to draw powerful emotions from me, and make me earn the successes that I’ll remember for years to come.\nIts unconventional approach to action-RPG gameplay walks a fine line between utter elation and despair as it takes us on an awe-inspiring journey through the highest peaks of satisfaction and the deepest, blackest pits of exhausted desperation. Developer From Software chooses to tell us little about how to survive its gauntlet, and yet expects feats of intelligence and perseverance in the face of its brutal, unrelenting difficulty. That balance is slightly upset by painfully long loading screens upon death or travel to different zones, but the highs of taking down one of the many intimidating bosses make up for those chunks of downtime.\nBloodborne’s semi-open world structure and hard-earned progression draw heavily from the Dark Souls and Demon's Souls games that made From famous, though the aggressive new pace of combat is all its own. These diving, rolling melee battles with an awesome arsenal of transforming melee weapons and tactical sidearms chiseled away my calluses and made me form new ones, even as a hardened Dark Souls veteran. Switching weapons between their light and heavy modes on the fly to string together combo-like attack chains in an engaging way injects a newfound versatility, even if it’s a less calculating kind of battle than we see in From’s earlier games.\nBloodborne’s horrifying beasts span an imaginative range, from pedestrian insane village folk to cosmic horrors and patchwork fiends.\n“\nThat doesn’t make it any easier, though. Being overwhelmed by enemies is commonplace, but thanks to your ability to leech back lost health with quick counterattacks and to stun opponents with secondary weapons, I found it’s possible to sustain a constant onslaught when I’d built up enough skill.\nAnd these tools are absolutely needed, as Bloodborne’s horrifying beasts span an imaginative range, from pedestrian insane village folk to cosmic horrors and patchwork fiends. Creature design strikes terror in many ways – enormous axe-swinging skeletons, peculiar semi-transparent childlike creatures, and subtle creepiness, like a coven of wailing, cleaver wielding hags – but each entity is well-crafted and triumphantly threatening. That’s best exemplified by the bosses, which have the power to mystify, terrify, and infuriate. I ultimately found many of those big fights much simpler than getting past the trial-and-error battles with dozens of smaller enemies I fought to reach them, but the satisfaction in each and every victory was huge.\nWhat's The Best Soulslike (or Souls) Game?\nPick a winner\nAnother Crab's Treasure\nSekiro\nNew duel\nThe progression that follows those hard-fought wins is a carefully doled-out treat in Bloodborne. For one thing, the glowing pale purple lamps that serve as its version of checkpoints are scarce. Surviving long enough to reach the next point is rarely an option you can count on, but delving out of your comfort zone to find a secret shortcut back to safety brings a wave of comfort. Unfortunately, the inability to warp between these lamps without a layover back to the Hunter’s Dream (your ethereal-feeling home base) is a needless annoyance that exacerbates the issue with the extended load times.\nThere’s a sense that this strange and dark place is alive.\n“\nAfter arriving at a destination, nearly every careful, blood-soaked step through the consistently stunning environments reveals something new about Bloodborne’s vague and cryptic lore. Whispers and clues are everywhere, begging to be interpreted. Despite a frame rate that all too often buckles under the strain of loading new areas or heavy action, the atmosphere retains its full effect. There’s a sense that this strange and dark place is alive. You could find a subtext of criticisms on real-world concepts like faith and worship in the understated dialogue, but taking each outrageously odd story point at face value is the more enjoyable path.\nYet your personal story will be created on your own terms, as you explore the spiderweb of paths and secrets that crisscross Bloodborne’s potent world. Everything is packed with hidden meaning, and spending time speaking with the forgotten citizens of the eerily rotting city of Yharnam yields new ways to interact with the world. At one point, I spoke with a victim of these dark circumstances who gifted me a family heirloom that seemed inconsequential at the time; it wasn’t until I took the time to read its description that it suddenly became a vital tool in a battle to come. Rewards in Bloodborne come with careful examination and curious effort, and I wouldn’t have it any other way.\nEverything is packed with hidden meaning.\n“\nThere’s so much to do and see and try here that I obsessed over finding every secret, which greatly extends Bloodborne’s already lengthy playtime – though that number can easily be extended in a New Game Plus, or the refreshing procedurally generated Chalice Dungeons. These areas aren’t just more of the same – they’re loaded with items that can be carried back into the main story, exclusive weapons and bosses, and the player-versus-environment replayability that the Souls series was always missing.\nTop 10 Soulslikes\nVIEW 11 IMAGES\nAnd though Bloodborne is mostly an isolating and solitary experience, subtle cooperative elements enhance that in fascinating ways. Spotting (non-interactive) ghostly shades of other players passing through your area, reading warnings and tips left by people who have come before, and studying reenactments of player deaths by activating prompts on the ground all serve as cautionary tales – immensely helpful in avoiding surprises that would otherwise leap out and kill you.\nI saved lives.\n“\nThough these features are all mostly identical to their earlier iterations in Dark Souls, some things have improved. The best addition to the messaging system is the inclusion of emotes that spring to life like a hologram when someone reads the message. On the lowest rung of Old Yharnam, in a grimey alleyway corner, I used the available pick-and-choose word selection to lay down the message: “item waits ahead, but beware ambush,” then aimed and added the ‘point’ emote for a visual indicator to point to where a killer waited in the shadows. According to the rating system, it’s been very helpful to others, and that’s a great feeling. I saved lives.\nRate Your Favorite Souls and Soulslike Games\nClick on Your Favorites to leave a Rating on Your Favorite Souls and Soulslike Games.\nSee All\nHollow Knight\nTeam Cherry\nLords of the Fallen\nHexworks\nElden Ring\nFromSoftware\nStar Wars Jedi: Survivor\nRespawn\nAs far as cooperative multiplayer, Bloodborne is every bit as obtuse as Dark Souls ever was. It allows you to call for help from another player when you need it most, such as a boss fight that feels like a brick wall or a group of enemies you don’t feel confident in taking on alone, by ringing a Beckoning Bell; any players ringing a response bell in the area will warp into your world. The catch (since there’s always a catch in Bloodborne) is that at the same time, you open yourself up to invasion from hostile players that are actively seeking to hunt and kill other hunters. In a rare move of compassion, this time around From has wisely included a password-protected game feature so that you and a friend can connect deliberately, removing some of the ambiguity of anonymous cooperation.\nVerdict\nBloodborne is an amazing, exacting, and exhausting pilgrimage through a gorgeous land that imposes the feeling of approaching the bottom of a descent into madness. Though extended load times and minor frame-rate hitches have an effect on the pacing, it’s otherwise an intensely challenging and rewarding game. There’s an incredible power to unlocking its mysteries, and in succeeding, despite its demand for a pound of your flesh.",

    "title": "Overwatch",
    "review": "Overwatch exists at an intersection between design and artistry, a crossroad at which pure tactile joy meets refined, intelligent design to create a rare spark of magic. As a 6v6 multiplayer, objective-based shooter, it finds accessibility not by lowering the skill ceiling, but by broadening the definition of skill. The person with deadshot aim is no more valuable than the person with the decision-making ability to know when a well-timed ability will turn an engagement, or the person with the map-sense to find the optimal locations to place sentry turrets. While it didn't exactly drown me in options, maps, and modes, it’s blessed with a multitude of tactical layers, and none of them ever came between me and my enjoyment of its intense, swirling teamfights, and thrilling overtime comebacks.\nUPDATE: OVERWATCH IS IGN'S 2016 GAME OF THE YEAR.\nOverwatch does a great many things well, but above all else, its success is built on the backs of its many excellent characters. It’s fitting that the main menu is dominated by one of them at all times; their diverse appearances, origins, and personalities are all laid bare with every pose they strike. Reinhardt’s rocket hammer lands on his shoulder with a meaty clank that invokes a broadsword resting against a medieval knight’s plate armor, and Tracer’s jovial smile is just briefly interrupted by a rebellious bang that slides across her face, tempting her to blow it back into place before re-addressing the camera and blinking all over the place. There’s an intelligent gorilla scientist, a lithe, blue-skinned assassin, and a cybernetic, zen-practicing healer too. It speaks volumes that the one character that adheres to well-worn shooter tropes feels like the odd man out here. They’re all so different that you’d imagine them looking silly standing next to one another, but through careful, subtle visual cues baked into their equipment and attire, they manage to appear as if they share a common world, even if they all hail from different corners of it.\nIt speaks volumes that the one character that adheres to well-worn shooter tropes feels like the odd man out here.\n“\nThis diversity continues to bear out when you pick a hero and hit the battlefield with them. Though the 21 characters (all of whom are unlocked from the start) are roughly grouped into one of four “roles,” no two feel alike. The robotic, transforming Bastion and the anarchic, explosive-tossing Junkrat are both technically Defenders, but they couldn’t play any more differently from one another. The former looks for a cozy spot overlooking a key choke point and transforms into a minigun turret to run point defense; the latter plays an area-denial game by lobbing timed grenades over long distances, which then sit on the ground blinking angrily, as if to say “go somewhere else” to encroaching enemies before exploding. This strong sense of differentiation is important because it keeps team composition strategies from devolving into simple formulas. No, two Tanks, two Supports, and two Attackers is not the magic solution for a winning team. You have to look much deeper – and when you do, the true beauty of Overwatch’s gameplay shines through.\nEvery Tool In The Box\nOne of the surprising keys to surfacing these nuances is its refusal to offer up crutches to lean on. With very few arguable exceptions, no character is focused solely around one catch-all gun or skill to the extent that you can find success by using it alone. Tracer’s dual machine-pistols have a high rate of fire but poor accuracy, a short clip, and middling damage if you aren’t scoring headshots. Genji’s shurikens are highly damaging and boast unerring accuracy, but their slow rate of fire and long travel time can make hitting a small moving target difficult. Almost every primary weapon fits this mold: they’re useful, and in the right situation quite powerful, but never versatile enough to be a security blanket to constantly cling to. Not only do these little details help differentiate characters, they pushed me to explore their other abilities in search of success.\nYou have to look much deeper – and when you do, the true beauty of Overwatch’s gameplay shines through.\n“\nAnd once I started looking more closely, I couldn’t stop discovering new things. Revisiting Junkrat’s toolset, he doesn’t have a single standard, reliable gun to just directly engage an enemy in front of him. Sure, he could skip grenades along the ground, leading his target as best he can, but even if you were good enough to reliably win one-on-one firefights this way, you wouldn’t be realizing his full potential.\n\nAt face value his other two skills – Steel Trap and Concussion Mine – seem straightforward. One immobilizes enemies that wander into it, the other blows them sky-high when triggered. In practice though, they can be so much more. Steel Trap can be an escape tool, allowing you to disengage from fights with faster enemies trying to get in your face. Its positional alert upon being triggered allows it to double as an early warning system too, letting you know that someone on the other team is attempting to flank your defenses and holding them there long enough for you to respond. Or, plant a Concussion Mine on top of a Steel Trap and just detonate it when you see it triggered while you’re off somewhere else peppering the objective with grenades. You can even use Concussion Mine as a regular old grenade by tossing it at a group of enemies and detonating it manually as it gets there. Perhaps most amusingly, you can detonate it under yourself to rocket-jump up to otherwise-inaccessible areas. Just two abilities on one character opens up all those possibilities, and as you might imagine, once you get 12 characters scrapping over objectives, using their abilities to help and hurt one another, further layers of tactical nuance begin to unfurl.\nFor example: On her own, Pharah can be a major headache by hurling herself high into the air and hovering there while raining rocket-propelled death down on opposing teams from angles that render both cover and positioning moot. But with Mercy the winged medic tending to her, Pharah becomes a whole different kind of problem. Mercy’s Guardian Angel ability allows her to swoop toward any ally in range, even ones up in the sky. Combined with her ability to slow her descent with her wings, she's the only character that can follow Pharah wherever she goes. So you end up with a dynamic duo flying all over the place – the one shoving rockets down people's throats while the other switches between healing her up and buffing her already substantial damage output as needed.\nThe sum of all these minute details is that almost every action, even the ones you repeat again and again, feel just a little bit magical.\n“\nOverwatch is rich with synergies like this: Reinhardt and Lucio, Zarya and Reaper, Torbjorn and Symmetra…there's no shortage of opportunities for keen, coordinated play, and when you reach a point where you feel comfortable switching your character on the fly in the middle of a match to capitalize on weak enemy team composition, you feel like a tactical genius.\n\nYou could spend many hours playing Overwatch before getting to that point by properly wrapping your brain around all the little intricacies it has tucked away behind its approachable veneer, but you certainly don't need to just to have a good time with it. Just trying out different characters, popping off their abilities, and moving through their world feels almost indescribably right, and it's all because of tiny, almost imperceptible details. The lid on Junkrat's grenade launcher flaps and clanks about with his every move, Lucio's movement has just the slightest touch of inertia, so you actually feel like you're skating when you play him. Zenyatta's reload animation might be my favorite; I never got tired of watching him open his arms to materialize a new set of orbs before clasping them together with a satisfying, metallic thud. It's a small thing, sure, but the sum of these minute details is that almost every action, even the ones you repeat again and again, feel just a little bit magical.\nThe Path To Victory\nOverwatch’s 12 maps are similarly flush with luxuriant details, and they also play a big role in extracting further depth out of the cast’s toolsets. The oppressive first chokepoint on Hanamura begs to have static defenses like Torbjorn’s turret or Symmetra’s sentries built around it, and for attackers with the right mobility skills (see Pharah and Mercy above) the long gap between the left side of the first and second capture point becomes a tantalizing opportunity to flank the defenders before they can reset themselves. Payload-escort maps like Route 66 provide high ground on either side of the attackers route, setting up paranoia-inducing ambush scenarios where Winston’s spherical Shell Barrier becomes invaluable for protection against threats that could be coming from several angles at once. This adds another interesting layer of strategizing and decision making when coming up with team compositions. You aren’t just thinking about how your character will work in the context of your team, but also about what opportunities any given map provides, and how you can exploit them.\nYou’re always in the fight, never wondering where it is or how to get there.\n“\nEvery map is directly tied to a specific objective type, so their construction is well-tailored to the action at hand. You never get that disjointed feeling of playing capture the flag on a team deathmatch map, like you might in other multiplayer shooters where maps have to accommodate a variety of modes. The upsides are subtle, but significant. Maps are focused without ever feeling constricted; there’s never any question about where you’re headed or how to get there, because every flanking path and side door eventually puts you where you need to be. In this way, Overwatch’s map designs allow you to choose your vector of engagement without risking you getting lost where the action isn’t happening. The result is zero wasted time; you’re always in the fight, never wondering where it is or how to get there.\nTying modes to maps in this one-to-one fashion has a small downside too though: Overwatch doesn’t have a ton of different modes to switch things up like most other games of its kind do. This isn’t Halo where most maps support various team sizes, objectives, and a slew of different modified rules. There’s only one way to play on Volskaya Industries: it will always be attack the first point, then attack the second. This lack of customization allows for finely tuned action, but also cuts into the overall breadth and variety of the experience when compared to other modern multiplayer games.\nOverwatch takes just about every possible opportunity to make its cast and locales seem like people and places rather than puppets and scenery.\n“\nBut like its characters, Overwatch’s maps are filled with nuances that will take time and repetition to learn, and not just from a mechanical standpoint. Bits of story and world-building can be found throughout the beautifully conceived environments. Movie posters in the spawn room of one map reveal that the mech-piloting pro-gamer D.Va’s real name is Hana Song, and that she had a movie career as well. Another map has a row of arcade machines, and if you happen to be playing as Genji, the cyber-ninja might start reminiscing about how many hours of his “misspent youth” he burned away playing there. Sometimes characters who have a past and don’t like each other find themselves on the same team, and you’ll hear about it. Overwatch takes just about every possible opportunity to make its cast and locales seem like people and places rather than puppets and scenery.\n\nIn terms of features, Overwatch is just a bit thin, but it meets most of the basic expectations of a multiplayer shooter and in some ways, exceeds them. Its impressive stat-tracking, per-character control mapping, and accessibility options stand out. It also does a great job of identifying and surfacing good play to teammates and opponents through a novel commendation system and a sweet “Play of the Game” highlight reel. Matchmaking is swift and reliable, and the cosmetic unlockables are surprisingly charming and come at a pretty decent pace without paying for extra loot packs. That said, I dug the characters' stock designs so much, I didn't want to stray too far from them anyway.\nVerdict\nOverwatch is an incredible achievement in multiplayer shooter design. It bobs and weaves almost perfectly between being the quick-fix adrenaline hit you might want after a long day of work, and the thoughtful, strategic multiplayer experience that becomes the center of evening-long binges with friends. It might not have the most exhaustive list of maps and modes, but it provides nearly endless opportunities for exhilarating, coordinated play, and when you’re the one at the center of it, it feels like nothing else.",

    "title": "Minecraft",
    "review": "No other video game has unleashed my creativity like Minecraft. I've spent countless hours chipping away at blocks, gathering the necessary materials to complete the next masterpiece that would otherwise only occupy my mind's eye. I've also spent just as many hours exploring, spelunking and slashing my way through monsters with bravado. My character – my entire Minecraft world – constantly evolves into whatever I want it to be. I tell my own stories, I write my own destiny and I bring my fantasies to life one brick at a time.\nMinecraft stands out not only for the way it inspires me creatively, but also because of its unique aesthetic. Look, I know the visuals look dated and a bit silly, but few games have visuals so endearing and charming. I know I'm not the only one who feels that way either, or else Minecraft's graphics wouldn't be so iconic. Could you take a texture from Gears of War, Halo or Uncharted, put it on a shirt and have players identify it? I doubt it. The looks just work, giving the game a super unique appearance that's memorable, and brings up a bit of nostalgia in me for 8-bit era games.\nI love creating in Minecraft, but my gratification is due, at least partially, to the fact that I have to earn everything. Survival Mode generates a random world with nothing to your name, forced to gather resources in order to construct food, shelter and tools. By the time I crafted and installed a wooden door in my first mud hut I felt a sense of ownership . Other games let you buy a home with the money you earn, but none of them really challenge you to forage for the materials and build it yourself. When I look at my home and see every piece of furniture and wall is exactly where I wanted it, I love it all the more or change it at my whim. From the moment my home was built, my mission was clear: tunnel into the earth in order to get whatever I needed to carve out a fortress in my little part of the world.\nCreating items in Minecraft is one of the most important actions you do. The problem, though, is the necessary information isn't found in Minecraft. The first time I beat my way through some trees and gathered wood, I had no clue what to do with it. Thankfully, like many Minecraft players, I had a mentor who pointed me to the various online forums, communities and wikis. I have pages that I return to all the time, often tabbing out of the game itself when I can't remember exactly how to craft an item. For many this is just a rite of passage, but mostly it's an obtuse way to handle crafting. I'd love for the recipes to be integrated into the game somehow, even if I had to find them throughout the world. There's not much of a sense of accomplishment in reading a wiki and just following instructions verbatim.\nEven after you find a good resource, it still takes a lot of effort to learn everything. The sheer amount of recipes and items you work with in the game is intimidating and time consuming to learn. Many games have poor documentation, but Minecraft has none at all, and what's available isn't easily digestible.\nBut Minecraft is still more than fun enough to warrant the learning curve. The addiction, though, really begins as you craft items and gain mastery over your surroundings. Suddenly night time, when monsters spawn and take over the unlit portions of the world, isn't as scary. I mean, it's always a bit scary, but having a sword in hand – even a simple, wood one – instills a sense of power. Like a caveman whittling their first spear or stoking their first fire, building simple tools and torches in Minecraft makes me feel safer, like I am the master of my fate because I have the power to create the items that can save me.\nBeyond safety, crafting creates a whole new set of goals in Minecraft. I crafted items as needed (tools and torches), but eventually I expanded my repertoire to include superfluous pieces. To finish my first stone keep I had to craft stairs and ladders; simply jumping up a simple series of platforms was unbecoming of the king of the land, after all. Crafting slowly became something I did less to survive, and more to complete the next big project I set out for myself. Creating panes of glass didn't really give me an edge in my world, for instance, but it did make the viewport of my scale Star Wars AT-AT look a lot more badass. Crafting even gets more complex if you want it to. You can create tools and buildings or elaborate self-powered rail systems, taking you from the stone age to the 20th century,, and making you feel like the fate of my world lies squarely in my hands. It's exhilarating, and instills a sense of power that I rarely feel in games.\nAfter I secured a plot of land in my world, my intentions during a session with Minecraft changed. Each session became an adventure, wherein I challenged myself to go exploring for the next crucial component parts needed for the next recipe. These self-imposed quests are why I sometimes venture into the Nether, a hellish other world where monsters – who just so happen to drop precious materials – live. Other times I venture into dark caves, donning crafted armor and enchanted weapons so that I can tackle whatever enemies I come across. I don't know what exactly I'll find, or what terrors I'll face, but I do it all in the name of finding precious blocks – and the thrill of the experiencing the unknown.\nThat thrill, that experience of unplanned and unpredictable adventure, makes every session with Minecraft exhilarating. Sometimes I might end up spending the evening doing mundane activities like farming or hunting for food, but other nights I might end up stumbling upon a gigantic, randomly generated mine that's full of monsters and treasure. Because each world is procedurally created, I never know just what I'll stumble upon next. One day my character may be a simple builder, the next he's a dungeon conquering hero who slays horrors in the dark.\nOf course, adventuring is always better with friends, and Minecraft's multiplayer is great fun if you can get it working. It isn't broken or a completely buggy mess, but requires a lot steps to get started compared to most games. If you want to start a game you'll need to download additional software, and go through all kinds of online tutorials to get it working. Players who just want to join a game have to know the server's I.P. address, since there is no server browser built into the game. Still, annoyances and tedium aside, if you have the option to play with others you definitely should; exploring, adventuring and building up epic structures is a lot more fun with friends. Besides, if you're going to spend hours of your life building gigantic monuments, you might as well have someone else to show them to. You can post them in online videos, but it just isn't the same as having your friend right next to you sharing in your accomplishment. Or, even better, having them log on after a period of inactivity to be stunned at the marvels you've built in their absence.\nIf you're not the type to play with others, and you don't want to earn all your materials, you can always jump into Creative Mode. In this world you're invincible, and have access to every item in the game. It's great if you want to, say, create a gigantic Wampa from Star Wars, but it doesn't give me the same sense of reward or accomplishment I get when playing Survival since I don't have to earn the blocks or fend for my life while doing so. Many blocks take considerable effort to acquire (some even make you journey into monster filled labyrinths), so when I build them in my Survival Mode it's a lot more impressive. Still, it's a fun distraction.\nVerdict\nLike any review, my feelings on Minecraft are the result of my experience with it. Maybe you don’t thrive off random adventures like I do, or maybe you won’t feel the same sense of accomplishment I did when I completed my first house. If not, then you likely haven’t or won’t enjoy Minecraft in the same way. And that’s OK. Minecraft, more than any other game I know, isn’t about playing it a specific way; it’s an open-world, a blank page just daring you to jump in and do with it what you will. The question, then, isn’t what you need to do to succeed, what’s needed to win, but what are you willing to do to make your dreams come to life?",

    "title": "Batman: Arkham City",
    "review": "Sometimes reviewers can't see the forest for the trees. When I finished Batman: Arkham City, I immediately cataloged what I thought it did wrong. It tossed in too many villains and didn't flesh them out, it clearly tried to replicate the Scarecrow stuff from the first game and didn't do it as well, and Batman still moves a bit stiffly when simply walking around. When I formed the list, I found myself disappointed with the game. But the days rolled on and I couldn't stop playing -- in fact, I only wanted to play more. The hundreds of things Batman: Arkham City nails outweighed my nitpicky problems. I realized Batman: Arkham City is a brilliant game.\n\n\nIf you've missed the roughly 1.4 million stories on IGN, Batman: Arkham City picks up months after the events of Asylum. Former Arkham warden Quincy Sharp now reigns as the mayor of Gotham City, and he's moved the bad guys from Blackgate Prison and the inmates from Arkham Asylum to a cordoned off area in the heart of Gotham. This is Arkham City, Dr. Hugo Strange runs it, and Batman's job is to see what the hell is going on inside. It's an interesting story that starts with one of the best openings in modern games. After two years of dreaming about where this sequel would go, Batman: Arkham City delivered and hooked me. That can be said for most of the game.\n\nFans of the Batman: Arkham Asylum will immediately be at home in Arkham City as developer Rocksteady took the core gameplay, refined it, and polished it. You brawl with one button, counter with another and leap when you feel like it. Batman's got a slew of new counter attacks -- including the ability to take out several attacking enemies at once -- and the ability to use nearly every gadget in battle with a hot key system. Even though the system can seem simple (that's if you ignore the combos and multipliers) the diversity in the attacks and battles keeps it interesting. I wanted to engage bad guys instead of sneaking past them. Maybe it was the promise of more experience points and the upgrades they unlocked, but it probably had more to do with wanting to see Batman dislocate another elbow.\n\nRocksteady kept me on my toes by peppering in special enemies. Guys with stun rods, armored outfits and broken bottles all have to be dealt with in very specific ways. I needed to assess threats and engage situations like Batman would. I don't know if I can express how awesome that makes a comic nerd like me feel; after years of hypothesizing how Batman would beat Character X, I now have to do it to survive.\n\nTHOSE GUYS ARE SCREWED.\nFeeling like Batman made Arkham Asylum a must-play, and Arkham City continues that tradition. I felt like I had the upper hand when I walked into a room where the enemies outnumbered me 20 to 1 because I could drop a smoke pellet, use freeze grenades to take enemies out of the game and basically kick ass. Five gunmen with hostages didn't scare me because I knew I could disappear into the shadows to string them up from gargoyles, punch through walls to take them down and glide kick them over railings.\n\nThis feeling of empowerment carries over to bosses, which is weird at first but makes sense. No boss in Arkham City really gave me a challenge. In fact, they're all a bit easy. Mr. Freeze had me stumped for a while as once you use an attack on him you can't use it again, but then the Bat-computer just sent me a cheat sheet. (Although, disabling hints would've eliminated this moment.) That specific instance was no fun, but overall, the joy of Batman bosses is the journey to them and not the fight themselves. The Penguin will never challenge the World's Greatest Detective.\n\nArkham City isn't an open world like Liberty City; it's more like a hub world with a bunch of dungeons like The Legend of Zelda or a bigger version of Batman: Arkham Asylum. You can't go into every building, but as you explore, you're going to find you're kept from discovering some of the 400-some Riddler Challenges until you double back with new gadgets. As you unlock the game's dozen side missions, you have to search nooks and crannies for murder victims and political prisoners in distress.\n\nDON'T USE THE BATCOMPUTER DURING THIS FIGHT.\nIf being Batman sounds good to you, expect to play this game twice and have the second time feel light years better than the first. New Game Plus unlocks after your first runthrough of Arkham City, and it carries over all your gadgets and shares your Riddler Challenge data. It also doesn't erase your original game's progress – it lives in its own section of your save. Historically, I despise playing games more than once. I know what's around the next corner, so where's the fun in it? Well, I adored Batman: Arkham City's New Game Plus. The difficulty is amped up, the enemies are more diverse from the get go, and the reversal indicators are turned off.\n\nNew Game Plus takes the training wheels off and forces you to be Batman. When Batman enters a fight, he knows how to win; he just needs to execute his plan. That's you in this mode. You already know what's coming, you just need to execute your 45-hit combo, dodge explosives and save the day. This left me feeling more like Batman than ever before.\n\nChallenges rooms return and have been given an update since the days of Arkham Asylum. There are a dozen combat challenge maps (take out the four waves of bad guys) and a dozen Invisible Predator challenges (sneak around and silently eliminate all the bad guys) and each comes with three medals to earn. All that is standard, but Arkham City offers up Riddler Campaigns. These link three challenges together and apply gameplay modifiers like low health, time limits and so on. There's even an option to make your own Bat-exams. These challenges mainly serve to point out how slow my version of Batman is, but I'm glad they're here. They help hone my skills and provide leaderboards to chase and keep me playing.\n\nCatwoman Conundrum\nLeading up to Batman: Arkham City, Rocksteady talked a lot about the Catwoman missions in the game -- that 10 percent of Arkham City was all about Selina Kyle. Well, it turns out that content isn't included on the disc. If you buy the game new, it comes with a one-time use code to download the Catwoman content. Used copies will most likely have the code snatched up and you'll need to buy the DLC off Xbox Live or the PlayStation Store.\nIf I can give you some advice, download and install the Catwoman missions before starting the game. Her four story missions, inserted throughout Batman: Arkham City, are a fun (albeit simple) change of pace, and literally change the opening of the game. I downloaded her stuff after beating the game the first time, and the integrated Catwoman stuff during my New Game Plus playthrough was way more enjoyable than just tackling her missions off the main menu. This is downloadable content that expands the mythos of the game as you're playing it. It explains events that are happening off camera.\nOutside of the four missions, the Catwoman DLC gives you challenge maps for the feline and the ability to get the special Catwoman Riddler Trophies in Arkham City.\nVerdict\nBatman: Arkham City isn't perfect, but listing the little things I didn't like gets in the way of all the stuff I adored. The voice acting, the challenges, the amazing opening, the unbelievable ending and the feeling of being the Dark Knight -- these are the things that standout looking back. I've beaten this thing twice and still want to call in sick and chase Riddler Trophies.\nBatman: Arkham City isn't just better than Batman: Arkham Asylum, it's better than most games on the market.",

    "title": "Super Mario Odyssey",
    "review": "I literally applauded as the end credits rolled on Super Mario Odyssey. I’d spent the last 15 hours with a giant grin on my face, and somehow the climax put the perfect surprising and delightful exclamation point on the plumber’s latest adventure. This is another brilliant redefinition of the very platforming genre he helped popularize 30 years ago.\nAnd best of all, even with the story complete, Odyssey has so much more fun to offer.\nIt evokes, honors, and is sometimes directly inspired by the games that came before it.\n“\nOdyssey looks like a straight successor to the Mario 64 and Sunshine line of sandbox 3D Marios, but it is much more than that. Naturally, it evokes, honors, and is sometimes directly inspired by the games that came before it in its characters, music, and mechanics. But it also has new things to say as well, like fusing classic-style 2D gameplay with the 3D world and using a completely new possession mechanic to add constant variety to Mario’s abilities and exploits.\nThat possession power, embodied by Mario’s new sidekick/headwear Cappy, is Odyssey’s big new idea. In keeping with Nintendo’s decades-long tradition of charmingly nonsensical storylines, he’s a hat with a soul, and he’s teamed up with Mario in order to rescue his sister Tiara who… wait for it... has been kidnapped by Bowser along with Princess Peach. (I said it was charming, not original.) Cappy’s power allows you to possess many other characters by throwing Mario’s hat at them, which bizarrely slurps Mario’s physical body inside of the enemy and gives you full control over their powers. Cappy’s also used as a jumping pad and a weapon, sparing Mario’s tuchus from an untold number of butt-stomps this time around (though you can still do that, if you wish).\nEvery IGN Super Mario Review Ever\nVIEW 31 IMAGES\nThroughout the entire campaign, you’re using new creatures in new, game-changing ways on a regular basis.\n“\nMany of the cleverest and most smile-inducing possessions are best left to be discovered for yourself, but whether it was thrashing about as a huge, realistic-looking T-rex in the prehistoric-themed Cascade Kingdom or becoming a lowly Goomba but then making a stack of Goombas 10-tall to win over a hard-to-impress Lady Goomba, Odyssey mixes up the gameplay in surprising ways in each of its 16-plus worlds. Throughout the entire campaign, you’re using new creatures in new, game-changing ways on a regular basis.\nOdyssey’s inspired integration of 2D gameplay – complete with Super Mario Bros.-era 8-bit art – deserves special mention. Entering into a pixelated pipe in the 3D space transports you to a side-scrolling 2D challenge that takes place on the surface of an object in the world, almost like Link’s 2D transformation in The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds. Most of these sequences aren’t too long – I wished they were longer, in fact – but each blends pure, weapons-grade retro gameplay with numerous other callbacks while still mixing things up in ways they never appeared in those original games, such as flipping gravity or wrapping the 2D scene around the corner of a 3D object. They bend the rules so far they go beyond even the most ambitious creations we saw in Super Mario Maker.\nIt’s super fun seeing Mario’s new costumes get translated into the old 8-bit art style.\n“\nIt’s also super fun seeing Mario’s new costumes get translated into the old 8-bit art style. My favorites include the aviator suit and the retro-colored builder outfit, for no other reason than them being fun looks for the veteran plumber, but you can also mix and match hats and outfits to your heart’s content.\nOf all the disparate lands Mario visits in his Odyssey, the urban-themed Metro Kingdom is my favorite. We’ve never seen anything like its semi-realistic look of New Donk City in a Mario game before. Not only do its urban obstacles allow for some kinetic platforming – bouncing off of the hoods of cars and flinging yourself off of city poles, for instance – but tucked-away minigames like an RC car race and a jump-rope challenge are great diversions. All the while, the sheer artistic contrast between the city and Mario’s consistently cartoony look and proportions have already generated interesting discussions about who – or more specifically what – Mario actually is. (Was “plumber” just a euphemism for some kind of goblin all along?) The end of the New Donk City portion might, in fact, be the very peak of the pleasure that Odyssey delivers on a consistent basis. Its conclusion is a literal celebration that doubles as a figurative one; Odyssey is pure joy that seems to understand and relish that about itself.\nI wasn’t prepared for just how much there is to do after it’s “over.”\n“\nOn that note, I strongly recommend playing on a TV whenever possible. It’s not that it plays poorly in handheld mode – it runs perfectly smoothly at 60 frames per second in either mode, although there are no touchscreen controls even in minigames where they’d have made sense. The drawback to playing on the go is that the tiny screen doesn’t do nearly as good a job of showing off the scope and detail of the characters and worlds, such as the funny faces Mario makes when performing certain actions and the tiny 8-bit icons hidden on some walls. (Toss Cappy at them to get a quick gold-coin reward!). Of course, it’s every bit as good a game in handheld mode.\nI expected to be able to continue playing even after the plot had been resolved, given Odyssey’s 3D sandbox structure, but I wasn’t prepared for just how much there is to do after it’s “over.” In fact, some of its finest moments follow the credits, from new unlockables that nod lovingly toward the past, to a clever new implementation of an old friend, to entire new worlds. I’m still not ready to put Odyssey down, nor do I expect to be for quite some time.\nIts challenge lies in exploration.\n“\nThat said, like internal Nintendo studio EAD’s other top-shelf Mario games – and unlike the “adapt and survive, or die trying” philosophy of Nintendo’s other 2017 masterpiece, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Odyssey isn’t particularly difficult. Most boss fights are over a bit quicker and easier than their gorgeous designs would suggest, and when you do fail, deaths tax you an almost meaningless 10 gold coins to try again from liberally distributed checkpoints. As such, you rarely lose much progress.\nInstead, its challenge lies in exploration. There are hundreds and hundreds of Power Moon collectibles to discover, and you’ll want to gather them because they are the keys that unlock new worlds – including the aforementioned post-credits locales! Many Moons are quite difficult to track down, and even once you’ve located them, it’s enjoyably challenging to try and suss out how to get your white-gloved mitts on them. Some are behind classic invisible walls, others are tucked away in linear areas that try to fool you into thinking there’s only one Moon inside of. Each is a fun mini-puzzle to solve – particularly the ones that newly dot the landscape after the story mode ends. I did my best to search thoroughly on my first pass through the campaign, but only ended up with a little more than 200, or less than a quarter of the total complement of collectible celestials.\nWhile Odyssey does a great job of thinking outside of the 3D platformer box, it doesn’t invent a way to slay all of the genre’s demons. The camera, for instance still causes trouble sometimes, leading you to whiff on a jump or get the wrong angle to see a boss attack coming.\nOn a logistical note: despite the fact that Nintendo recommends playing with separated Joy-Con controllers when you first start Odyssey up, you can play with whatever you like and not miss a beat in the gameplay. In fact, I felt much more comfortable with the fantastic Switch Pro Controller, which lets you do most of the same motion-based gestures by waving the gamepad. It also supplies all of the same HD Rumble feedback the Joy-Con do.\nWhere to Buy\nSuper Mario Odyssey - Switch\n3\n$59.99 save 15%\n$50.70 at Amazon\nVerdict\nMario’s games have been around for almost as long as game consoles have been a thing, but thankfully, he’s always evolving. We rarely get the same Mario twice. Super Mario Odyssey delivers on that ongoing promise of originality and innovation: It distills the venerable series’ joyful, irreverent world and characters and best-in-class platforming action, and introduces a steady stream of new and unexpected mechanics. It’s all spun together into a generational masterpiece.",

    "title": "The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings",
    "review": "The world of The Witcher 2 is a volatile, violent place filled with selfish, furtive characters. As monster slayer Geralt of Rivia, you'll need to not only combat beasts and bandits, a case of amnesia and the public perception that you're responsible for regicide, but also navigate between powerful figures and unravel complex conspiracies amidst a huge cast of power-obsessed monarchs and magic users. It's an adventure where choices that appear inconsequential slap the story in unexpected directions and one that doesn't compromise its fiction in the name of convenience or accessibility. In some ways those qualities are flaws, but they also contribute to a world that feels convincing, making its initial inaccessibility seem inconsequential relative to the intrigue and revelations embedded further in.\n\nThe characters in The Witcher 2 exist in a land of monsters, celestial bodysnatchers and magic, and though there are stereotypes walking around, they're not all typical video game fantasy fare. Even the supposed heroes are hopelessly self-serving, arrogant and impudent. This isn't a game afraid to paint its characters as racists, sexists, drunkards or just generally reprehensible people governed by fear and uncertainty, including Geralt and his friends. Those styled as saviors and leaders possess far more flaws and secrets than they initially let on, and as a result the characters don't feel like Pez dispensers of brittle phrases, they feel human.\n\n\nThere are so many involved in the game's labyrinthine plot of conspiracies, ancient curses and power grabs it's easy to get lost. If you didn't play the 2007 original, expect to spend a while reeling in bewilderment. There's a journal to help you sort out the main personalities, but little to aid you when characters speak only in colloquialisms. Toss in a few storytelling elements that seemingly pop up at random, like stylized animated flashbacks and moments where control is briefly switched from Geralt to other characters, and The Witcher 2's pacing can be disorienting. Despite that, it lends further authenticity to the world that a ruler of a region would not take the time to explain himself when referencing names and places. Geralt too, a well-traveled figure of renown, would hardly need someone to describe the difference between Aedirn, Kaedwen and Temeria. So while characters don't often launch into detailed explanations, it fits the fiction considering Geralt is not the genre-standard naïve paragon of morality stepping away from his home town for the first time.\n\nGeralt slides into the background of major conflicts and, though he provides critical assistance, he is never the obvious hero. He is feared by townsfolk and soldiers because of his appearance and reputation, and he's as flawed as you want him to be. Decisions can be as minor as determining how to deal with a small-town drug peddler to undercutting the significance of one of the game's major motivations in the pursuit of love. There's no +7.2 to your evil rating when you choose to punch someone in the face. There's no morality meter at all. Instead, the quests and opportunities change to accommodate your version of Geralt. It lends an exhilarating mutability to the experience, as dialogue responses could trigger results as mundane as a quest giver's disappointment or significantly alter the path of the main progression, even going so far as determining on which side you stand in major conflicts.\n\nThough The Witcher 2 does not offer a huge number of quests, none feel like arbitrary endeavors. Even the basic kill quests feature multiple steps, requiring you to explore the terrain surrounding the game's population centers, hunt creatures and eventually strike at nests and more formidable creatures. Some involve stealth, some collection, and all are wrapped in enough story to make the label \"side-quest\" seem inadequate. Whether it's venturing into the depths of a foreboding forest ruin and dealing with furious spirits or negotiating with a succubus in a mountainside warren, with few exceptions the quests in The Witcher 2 refuse to blend together into forgettable haze.\n\nIt's a little disappointing the voice acting and writing aren't consistently on the same level as other aspects of the game. Many lines for Triss, Geralt's initial love interest, aren't delivered with the conviction of others on the cast, Geralt's expressions in combat are repeated too often, and for as many hilariously brusque uses of profanity as there are, some of the cursing feels as though it's merely there to mask a lack of substance. Still, it's a dramatic improvement over the original Witcher, and only noticeable here because so many other aspects of the game are so stunning.\n\n\n\nReview Journal\nLooking for more info on The Witcher 2? Head over to IGN's review journal.\nThe visuals, in particular, are consistently gorgeous. Though I experienced some performance issues on launch day, a driver update allowed smooth play on max settings with a GeForce GTX 580 card, and the game still looks great at lowered settings. Provided you can turn everything up, the resulting virtual vistas are unmatched in modern role-playing games. From the towering heights of besieged ramparts at the game's outset to the glittering forests surrounding the riverside town of Flotsam, The Witcher 2 is one of the prettiest games you can play. The lighting effects as beams bloom through trees and light up mountain peaks make adventuring all the more exciting, and the animations are far more natural and plausible than in Geralt's previous adventure. The special effects impress, and so do the more subtle effects like the detail jammed into every one of Flotsam's worn and dirty shacks, or the waterfall that cuts through Vergen's rocky mountain walls. It's a world constructed with care where everything feels custom-built, nothing cut-and-paste.\n\n\nA lot of time clearly went into the interface design as well. It's all artistically presented but not without flaws. The process of applying mutagens is strangely cryptic, and separating potion creation and consumption into different menus is inefficient. They're minor inconveniences, but will stand out to any that favor function over flashy presentation. I'm a sucker for collecting plants and reagents to create powerful armors and potions too, and though there's plenty of that in The Witcher 2, frustrations like finicky item list navigation and Geralt's inability to offload inventory items for storage serve as sore spots. Expect frequent bouts of buying and selling to stay under a weight cap, which sucks up more time than it should.\n\nAll this collection and crafting enhances Geralt's abilities in combat, which, aside from a few annoyances, are fast and fun without losing depth. At the beginning of The Witcher 2 you're tossed into precarious situations and must immediately take advantage of all aspects of the combat system. Geralt relies on two swords – steel for humanoids and silver for monsters – to deal damage. To complement this he can set up traps, toss bombs, throw knives and tap into a number of magical abilities to carve up the opposition in real-time battles. Managing all this is easy enough once you get comfortable with the command wheel that slows time while allowing access to swords, items and magic. The trick is figuring out what everything does right from The Witcher 2's opening moments, from the way the Yrden magical sign locks enemies in temporary energy shackles to how Axii can mind-control enemies. You absolutely have to take advantage of all these elements if you want to succeed at the outset with the difficulty cranked. Once over the initial difficulty speed-bump, battles become varied, satisfying sequences of superpowered swordplay, though the boss battles, once you grow accustomed to their spectacular scale, can be infuriatingly punishing.\n\nFAST, EXCITING COMBAT.\n\nAs Geralt levels, talent points can be distributed across a skill tree to enhance existing abilities as well as unlock new ones, though specialization decreases the need to use all combat options. By dumping points into the magic talent line, for instance, the Quen sign takes on an increased significance, allowing Geralt to temporarily block incoming attacks by summoning an electrical shield that discharges damaging bolts to aggressors. Combined with a powered-up Igni spell to singe enemies with fireballs and, eventually, an Adrenaline Gauge, there's isn't as much of a need to use every skill to survive encounters. Fighting is still fun throughout and upgrading skills allows for noticeable increases in power during battle, but it feels backwards to have to rely on every skill at the outset and then a smaller number toward the end. Even so, it's a flexible system, and one that benefits from a tidy amount of well-defined combat options instead of an overwhelming amount with overlapping functionality.\n\nIt's also a system that punishes mistakes. If you're not paying close attention it'll only take a matter of seconds to be shredded by harpies and gutted by wraiths. The potion system is set up so you can't quaff restorative items mid-fight. Instead, you drink them down before an encounter begins to boost the regenerative rates of health and vigor (which limits magic use and parrying), meaning even when the effects are active in a fight, you still can't charge into combat mashing the attack buttons and expect to do anything but die. This kind of system that forces more thoughtful, skillful combat does wonders for the sense of satisfaction after clearing a group of enemies without feeling unfair. The one truly problematic area of the combat is the targeting system, which can be jumpy and imprecise at the worst times. It is possible to lock on to single targets, but in large groups when enemies are shifting positions, casting spells and shooting arrows, it's not easy enough to shift Geralt's focus to a desired target in a fast, precise manner, which can result in frustrating deaths.\n\nThe original Witcher had technical problems when it launched, making The Witcher 2's relative level of polish all the more impressive. I only experienced a handful of bugs through my entire run through the game, and only one or two crashes. For this to be the case this early for a game this complex, I have to believe it's a good sign for whatever content is to follow. And there will be more, to be sure, considering how many unresolved conflicts are stirred up throughout the course of The Witcher 2's run. By the end some of the major questions are answered, but it's tough to feel entirely content considering how the overarching large-scale conflict is clearly left open for future installments of the franchise.\n\nAN IMPRESSIVE ATTENTION TO DETAIL THROUGHOUT.\nVerdict\nThe Witcher 2 is a dense, deep role-playing experience where your decisions have a significant impact on not only the structure of individual quests but also the direction of the main plot. Its world is stunningly realized with beautiful effects and an obsessive attention to detail. The plot stubbornly refuses to slow down and often unexpectedly spirals into crescendos of betrayals and wild revelations involving a huge cast of scheming characters who don't feel like tired video game stereotypes; they feel human. Combined with the remarkable environment design and to a lesser degree the decent writing and voice acting, the atmosphere of The Witcher 2 is one of unrivaled authenticity. The fast-paced swords and sorcery combat system, though not without quirks, provides plenty of entertainment, and the crafting and alchemy systems mean there's incentive to explore and collect. The Witcher 2 is alternately offensive and endearing, grimy and gorgeous, and never ceases to surprise. It's one of the great titles of 2011, and one of the best role-playing games in years.",

    "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask",
    "review": "Put down your torches and pitchforks, stop shouting in the streets and step back inside to grab your wallet and boot up the Wii Shop -- because after another lengthy span of less-than-stellar releases for the retro download service, the Virtual Console is worth caring about once again. This time around the reprieve from the on-going assault of below-average \"classics\" comes courtesy of a milestone, as today marks two and a half years of the VC's existence and the arrival of its 300th title here in the States. And Nintendo couldn't have picked a better game to herald the event, as today we're finally getting The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask.\n\nMajora's Mask is a classic installment in the Zelda franchise, an instant hit with fans and critics alike when it first debuted around eight and a half years ago on the Nintendo 64. There, it became the second Zelda game on that particular console -- placed as a follow-up to The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and also serving as a storyline sequel to the events in that masterpiece. But even though Ocarina was a nearly impossible act to follow, Majora's Mask still managed to shine in its shadow -- thanks, in large part, to its completely unique design concept and its darker overall tone.\n\nAs Majora's Mask begins, we find our young hero Link on a lonesome quest -- he's lost his fairy friend Navi, and is searching a mysterious forest for signs of where she's gone. Suddenly, though, he and his horse Epona are attacked by a cackling, maniacal assailant -- the masked, mad and unpredictable Skull Kid. Link soon finds himself swept up into a chase to follow after the villain, but it proves a bit too successful -- he catches up with Skull Kid, only to have his newest enemy turn on him, curse him by transforming him into a lowly Deku Scrub, and retreat into an alternate reality of Hyrule known as Termina.\n\nTHE FACE OF FEAR.\n\nIt's an engaging introduction to an epic adventure, as you're immediately introduced to one of the core new play mechanics in Majora's Mask -- transformations. In his cursed Deku form, Link is shorter than ever, deprived of his sword and seemingly helpless. But he finds that he's able to access new methods of attack like a whirlwind spin and a bubble-blowing burst -- and he's able to take advantage of special Deku flowers in key locations to launch into the air and fly with a helicopter made of spinning flower petals.\n\nThe curse turns out to be a blessing, especially after you've managed to \"heal\" Link and turn the Deku spirit into a mask. Then, as an item in your inventory, it can be called upon at any time to solve puzzles, navigate flower-filled, flight-demanding rooms in dungeons, and even infiltrate Deku Scrub societies.\n\nOther transformations come into Link's possession later on, too, including a Goron form that allows him to punch out enemies with huge, pounding fists and roll into a spike-shelled boulder for faster travel across the land than even Epona can provide, and also a Zora form that gives our hero the ability to swim like a torpedo and fire boomerang-like fins from his arms. You'll also amass a whole wealth of other masks that don't trigger total transformations, but are nonetheless incredibly useful -- like the Bunny Hood, which doubles normal Link's running speed, and the Bremen Mask, which lets you take command of chickens like some kind of Pied Piper.\n\nThe masks mechanic is so deep and involved that, by itself, it probably would have been enough to build this entire adventure on. But, this time, Link transforming back and forth into four different forms isn't even the most important new addition to the design here -- that distinction goes to time itself.\n\nLooming up in the sky above the land of Termina is an enormous, grinning moon. And it's getting closer. And closer. And closer still. The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is played under the constant watch of this massive, intimidating heavenly body and it's constantly moving nearer to a cataclysmic impact with the planet's surface below -- it's set to crash down and end all life in Termina in just three days.\n\nMajora's Mask is played, then, with a constant and continuous countdown clock ticking ever closer to the end of the world, all the time. It's a freaky thing, and gives the game a feeling of tension and sense of urgency unmatched by any other Zelda series installment -- you can't just waste time, wandering around, doing nothing. You have to be on the move, all the time.\n\nTAKING FLIGHT.\n\nNow you don't just have 72 in-game hours to finish the entire quest -- Link ultimately discovers ways to slow the countdown down, and to reset events back to the beginning of The First Day by playing songs on his ocarina. But any changes you've made in the world always get reset, too, when you travel back in time -- if you save a citizen of Termina's central city Clock Town from some disaster, then warp back in time, they won't be saved any more.\n\nAnd there's nothing you can do about it. The game has so many different activities and events for you to take part in over the course of the same three days that it's actually impossible to be everywhere and do everything -- you'll always miss something. You'll never save everybody.\n\nIt's that dismal reality that fuels the darker overall tone of the story in Majora's Mask, and what makes this Zelda game ultimately so compelling in contrast to the rest of the series -- you can ultimately achieve a happy ending and save the world of Termina from destruction, but along the way you'll be forced to realize that you can't be everyone's hero all the time. Sacrifices must be made.\n\nNow, before wrapping things up here, we could go into greater detail about the rest of Majora's Mask's gameplay -- but beyond those two major new mechanics, it's 3D Zelda as you know and love. Exploring the overworld, locating dungeons. Discovering new items and songs for your ocarina that open up other, previously inaccessible areas of the game map. Beating bosses, increasing your life meter with heart containers and all the rest. It's true Zelda. It's just darker than usual, with haunting transformations and the end of the world hovering, literally, in plain view above you all the time.\nVerdict\nThe Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is an incredible adventure, and one that's a steal for the asking price of only 1000 Wii Points. The only reason you might not want to download it right away is if you have a copy of The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition -- that was a GameCube promotional disc from 2003 that contained Majora's Mask, along with Ocarina of Time and the two NES Zeldas. With it, and the Wii's compatibility with GameCube discs, you could have already played Majora's Mask through your Wii machine several times over already. And if that's the case, it'd be understandable for you to take a pass this time around.\nBut, failing that, you really should put down the 10 bucks and grab this great game immediately. Majora's Mask is a masterpiece, a game so well regarded that it earned our Game of the Year award in 2000. It's the perfect way to restore your faith in the potential of the Virtual Console, and will be one of the best ways you ever spend any amount of Wii Points supporting that service. Great selection for your 300th release, Nintendo. We appreciate the chance to appreciate the VC again.\nNote: Since a few readers in the Comments box below have brought it up, you can rest assured that the emulation in this VC edition is glitch-free. The version of Majora's Mask made available on the Collector's Edition GameCube disc was plagued by some sound and transition issues that didn't destroy the play experience, but were certainly annoying to deal with. Well, they've been dealt with and dealt out of the deck -- VC Majora is perfectly presented, so download with confidence.",

    "title": "Hollow Knight",
    "review": "It’s not hard to get lost in the deep, subterranean world of Hollow Knight – and I mean that in more ways than one. The expansive catacombs of Hallownest have countless paths to explore and secrets to find. But more than that, it’s rich with lore, history, and purpose that drew me into a 2D Metroidvania kingdom I wanted to uncover every inch of.\nThe deeper I went into Hollow Knight, the more I was surprised at just how much content and freedom it has to offer. I could wander in basically any direction and find bosses to fight, upgrades to collect, and secrets to uncover. But what’s truly captivating about the exploring this long-dead kingdom is its atmosphere. Art, music, color tone, sound, and a million other little details combine to give each area of the map a distinct sense of place, and those areas jigsaw together in a way that feels intentional and alive.\nWorld Wide Web\nThere are far more of these distinct biomes than I ever expected to discover, and the edges of each one blend together with the next in ways that help them make sense in the world. For example, walls on the border of the Fungal Wastes, even impassable ones in other areas, will be dotted with its telltale mushrooms. The lush environment of an area called Greenpath feels bustling and humid, a stark difference to the cold, dark caves of the Forgotten Crossroads. The bubble-filled region of Fog Canyon isn’t technically underwater, but the muffled filter over all of its audio goes hand-in-hand with jellyfish enemies and a brighter blue tone.\nScreens - Hollow Knight\nVIEW 35 IMAGES\nHallownest’s capital city, the City of Tears, is a metropolis in a huge cave where it’s always raining. But it wasn’t until 10 hours after I first discovered this place that I stumbled across the Blue Lake, a massive body of serene water positioned just above the underground city. Hollow Knight doesn’t shove this connection in your face, it just lets you explore its world and piece together the story for yourself as you sit down and enjoy a moment of quiet.\nIts lore is so deep that I feel like I could write a book on it.\n“\nIn fact, Hollow Knight tells you very little about what’s going on, and instead sends you into a world full of monumental events that all happened long before you arrived: wars and heroes, love and culture, disease and destruction. The aftermath of Hallownest’s troubled past is left for you to discover and comes through loud and clear, but only if you take the time to listen. It’s told in a very subtle way, but teaches you so much about Hallownest in the process that I feel like I could practically write a book on it.\nIt’s a tragic tale, one full of fallen heroes and terrible decisions, but it still manages to make time for beautiful, calm, and hopeful moments throughout. And it’s easy to enjoy those moments, because Hollow Knight’s hand-drawn art is simply beautiful. It’s a world that manages to feel cohesive despite its citizens being adorable bug-people in a dying cave.\nThe story (and your place in it) is picked up as you go. Some of it through dialogue with the adorable and quirky characters who still reside in this decrepit kingdom, some through important story events, and some just by observing your surroundings and the clues strewn about it. After my second playthrough, I have a fairly clear picture of Hallownest’s history, but it’s a picture I assembled myself.\nHow much have you played Hollow Knight?\nI haven't tried it yet\nI started but haven't finished\nI beat it\nI beat it and came back for more\nAnswer\nSee Results\nAs much as I genuinely loved being pushed out of the boat and told to start kicking, Hollow Knights’ first few hours can be a predictably sink-or-swim experience as a result. It’s an unashamedly challenging game that does a great job of silently teaching you how to play, but it still felt a little bit daunting to start — especially when death means having to fight your way back to your corpse to reclaim your money, called Geo.\nHollow Knight clicked in a way that made me never want to put it down.\n“\nYou have to find a map seller named Cornifer in each area before you can start keeping track of where you’ve been, and even then you have to equip a specific charm to see where you are on it in real time. That, coupled with fact that getting good at the combat takes practice, means I spent my first couple hours just trying to figure Hollow Knight out.\nBut once I picked up the rhythm of its combat and the pattern of exploring its initially restrictive cave systems, Hollow Knight clicked in a way that made me never want to put it down. After Greenpath, the second major area, you reach a point where there’s no clear “correct” direction anymore. Like any Metroidvania, your path options are gated behind things like ledges too high to reach or gaps too far to jump until you find the necessary upgrades, but there are enough options that don’t result in dead ends to keep to you exploring for quite a while.\nCLICK ON THE IMAGE ABOVE TO GO TO IGN'S INTERACTIVE HOLLOW KNIGHT MAP.\nHidden around the Kingdom of Hallownest are traditional Metroidvania abilities like a dash and a wall climb to help you better navigate its caves and reach new places. These new movement abilities also allow you to move through new paths in familiar terrain faster and more efficiently, giving the obligatory need to retread old ground (which does happen a fair amount) fresh life. Suddenly your wall climb turns that small gap between platforms into a shortcut instead of a hazard.\nNew movement abilities give the obligation to retread old ground fresh life.\n“\nThankfully, there is also a flavor-filled quick-travel system called the Stagways. Stag stations can be found and unlocked across Hallownest, allowing you to call The Last Stag to take you between them. What could just be a jump between points instead becomes a quest in itself, and I almost always spoke to The Stag after unlocking a station not to travel, but to hear his gruff but optimistic take on whatever new stop I brought him to.\nHollow Knight’s world also undergoes more concrete changes as you progress. Railways and elevators will unlock permanently, opening shortcuts that loop back to earlier sections and easing the burden of backtracking. One early area eventually even morphs into a much harder late-game section in a way that makes it feel like your actions in Hallownest have real weight.\nHammer Meets Nail\nThe combat in Hollow Knight is relatively straightforward, but starts out tricky as you learn to time quick directional sword slashes with jumps and dashes. It rewards patience and skill massively — killing enemies is a matter of sharp timing, learning attack patterns, and having quick reflexes more than just the upgrades you earn along the way. You can find upgrades to your weapon damage, increase your max health, and equip charms with a variety of abilities, but more importantly, I just got better as I went. A boss that gave me tons of trouble at the start of the game was a pushover when I returned for a second playthrough.\nAnd while your timing requires precision, the combat itself is somewhat forgiving. Hitting enemies lets you collect a resource called Soul which you can stop and channel at any time to heal, as long as you don’t get hit. So while the all-or-nothing nature of dropping your Geo on death gives exploration a sweaty-palmed tension, Hollow Knight also gives you the tools to take a breath, gather Soul, and get your health back up.\nThere are a decent amount of smaller enemies scattered around each level as well, acting as weaker baddies that let you recover Soul and collect Geo in relative safety. But there are just as many scary opponents too, and dying far from a checkpoint is a real risk. The enemy variety is impressive to say the least, with nearly 100 different types to fight, and even ones with similar behaviors looking dramatically different depending on what area of the map you find them in.\nEnemy variety is impressive to say the least, with nearly 100 different types to fight.\n“\nA charm system allows you to customize your own methods for killing those enemies as well. Each charm takes up a set number of notches (which you can earn more of along the way) and range from small effects, like extending your attack distance or gathering more Soul on hits, to large trade-off changes, like doubling your health but preventing you from healing at all, which can dramatically change how you play.\nThe 15 Hardest Contemporary Games\nVIEW 16 IMAGES\nThankfully, you can freely swap them out whenever you sit at a bench, which also serve as Hollow Knight’s save points and healing stations. That meant I could come up with specific combinations to counter different scenarios on the fly. I had my favorite loadout for general use, a loadout that upped the amount of Geo I got and collected it automatically, and a loadout for moving more quickly. If you prefer using Hollow Knight’s Soul-consuming damage abilities instead of swinging your sword (called a Nail) you could equip charms that increase Soul damage and even change your attacks entirely.\nThrough all my experimentation, it never felt like there was a wrong choice.\n“\nFor some harder boss fights that didn’t give me an opportunity to heal, my loadout even shifted to maximizing my temporary health at the cost of unequipping charms I had grown to rely on. Through all that experimentation, it never felt like there was a wrong choice. All the charms are good, and they all work, and it’s up to you to determine which you like the most and which work best for the scenario in front of you.\nAnd if any situation will push you to test those choices out, it will likely be one of Hollow Knight’s copious amount of boss fights. Seriously: there are dozens of different bosses, ranging from small and quick enemies to large, deadly brutes. These contained challenges are some of the best thrills available because they force you to find a strategy, learn when it’s safe to attack or heal, and get better each time you get crushed\nBecause believe me, you will get crushed. Those hard losses occasionally slowed my momentum, but there is almost always some other path to explore. If I was having trouble pushing through in one direction, I’d just wander down another until I got stronger (or just better) and decided to face that tough fight again.\nSoul Searching for Secrets\nIn fact, a staggering amount of Hollow Knight’s best content is entirely optional. You could probably beat the campaign without seeing two-thirds of what it has to offer, though the quest to get an alternate (and much better) ending will pull you in front of significantly more. Bosses, thoughtful story, and whole sections of the map can remain hidden, which adds to that feeling of actually exploring this world when you do stumble upon them.\nNone of Hollow Knight's optional content feels like filler.\n“\nThe key here is that none of this optional content feels like filler. I actively wanted to find every secret I possibly could and learn what was actually going on in the story. It all felt unique, significant, and wonderfully put together. Even after the 30+ hours it took me to truly beat Hollow Knight, I was excited to go back for more.\nHaving so much to do at any given time can admittedly be overwhelming at points. There can be so many open paths on your map that the burden of deciding which to explore next can make you doubt which is the “right” way. But the beauty of Hallownest is that there is very rarely a right or wrong choice, and it’s unlikely two players will explore these caves in the same order.\nHollow Knight has also been getting free post-launch content updates since its launch on PC last year, all of which are included on Switch (and more updates are on the way, according to developer Team Cherry). Those patches have added new areas and new bosses, and one even added the ability to add custom markers to your map. The simple act of being able to visually track when I need to revisit an area or which paths I’ve yet to go down is a godsend. It has helped me take stock of what needs to be done alongside the other late-game amenities Hollow Knight makes available for completionists, like maps that will eventually track certain collectibles.\nMuch of what’s worth finding past the point where you can “beat” Hollow Knight is pure, concentrated lore.\n“\nBut so much of what’s worth finding past the point where you can “beat” Hollow Knight is pure, concentrated lore. To really get a picture of what you’re doing (and to properly inform an important choice you have to make) you need to explore. I love that those key moments in the story tie into some of the best gameplay challenges it has to offer as well.\nFor example, one of the final secret areas basically transforms Hollow Knight into a Super Meat Boy-style platformer with very little combat. Platforming challenges exist all throughout the world, with some of the most thrilling requiring you to use your Nail as a pogo stick while you bounce across spikes, Duck Tales-style — but this area is something else entirely, and tells you about the history of that location with its themes.\nAnd, as I mentioned before, the music adds to that setting and art one thousand times over. While each location has its own theme and boss fight music, individual melodies and instruments will shift in and out as you move from screen to screen. The mood and tension of a scene are often driven by that music, and the soundtrack has quickly become one of my favorites.\nVerdict\nHollow Knight is a Metroidvania with a well of content to discover that’s as deep as its labyrinthine caves. The world of Hallownest is compelling and rich, full of story that’s left for you to discover on your own, and built with branching paths that offer an absurd amount of choice in how you go about discovering it. With such a high density of secrets to find and fun, challenging enemies to face, it’s worth spending every moment you can in Hollow Knight.",

    "title": "Nier: Automata",
    "review": "After trading fisticuffs with a Transformer, cartwheeling around a bullet-spewing tank controlled by evil clowns, and using a moose to buck my way through killer robots, it’s safe to say that there are very few games – if any – quite like Nier: Automata. At different times it’s a hack-and-slash, an RPG, a shoot-‘em-up, a brawler, and even a text adventure. But no matter which style it is at any given moment, this dazzling hybrid delivers 30-plus hours of fantastically fun action, remarkable locations, and a story so weird I doubt I’ll forget it anytime soon.\nNier: Automata takes place in a desolate but stunning futuristic dystopia where humanity has fled to the moon after an extraterrestrial invasion, leaving behind an army of androids to fight the aliens’ more primitive but prolific machines. It’s a world where lush green tendrils of ivy coil around the massive skeletal remains of crumbling skyscrapers and tears of rust streak down the sides of old factories, with rotund buildings and looming cranes dominating the skyline.\nAutomata’s striking art style and enormous sense of scale are mesmerizing.\n“\nAutomata’s striking art style and enormous sense of scale are mesmerizing to look at on the PlayStation 4, but especially on the PlayStation 4 Pro. It doesn’t go above 1080p on the Pro, but colors appear fresh and vivid, while better lighting and shading bring the world into sharper focus. I did encounter a few hiccups that knocked the frame rate below 60fps and witnessed a fair share of texture pop-in, but they only pockmarked Automata’s lovely features ever so slightly. That, or I was too enchanted with the soaring, chorus-filled soundtrack to really notice; Automata will definitely be joining its predecessor’s score on my playlist.\nThe story that takes place amongst the tumbled remains of abandoned superstructures is bizarre and entertaining, if somewhat haphazard. First as an android named 2B and later as other characters experiencing the same events from different perspectives, your job is to fight the alien machines and bring an end to the war. The quirky, full-tilt drama that unfolds as you bounce between Earth and the moon is an intriguing one, touching on existential themes like the meaning of life and humanizing those on the other side of war. It works, for the most part, due to a couple of bonkers plot twist and well-done voice acting that helps sell the more outlandish bits of allegory.\nLike its predecessors Nier and Drakengard, Automata does have an unfortunate tendency to wander into uber-convoluted territory, and this is where problems start to arise. Try as I might, I couldn’t always understand what was happening, even after I played through several of Automata’s multiple endings. There are also some emotional moments that struck me as forced. It's as if the game's lead writer Yoko Taro wanted to make me cry and was casting about for ways to make that happen. (To be fair, one event did have me pretty darn misty-eyed.)\nI was happy to see familiar faces from the original Nier.\n“\nThe bigger issue was the disconnect I felt from 2B and her fellow androids. Their personal dramas take too long to unwind, which prevented me from fully investing in their fates. Why should I weep or cheer for them if I’m not given a reason until 20 hours in? With that said, I was happy to see familiar faces from the original Nier pop up to help clarify the connection between it and Automata. Their presence brought about a welcome sense of nostalgia and helped bring closure to Nier: Gestalt's open-ended finale.\nI didn’t feel much of a rapport with the heroes, but I definitely enjoyed playing as them. There’s an incredible sense of freedom that comes with effortlessly surfing sand dunes in the desert and shimmying up the concrete remains of office buildings in Automata’s open world. Parkouring plays a big role here, and it’s highly enjoyable thanks to ultra-fluid controls and a very smart camera that effortlessly tracks the action no matter how insane things get. And things get pretty nuts: Automata’s different flavors of combat are a maniacal, supersonic affair, and a total blast to play.\nAutomata is described as an action RPG, but it’s really an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink kind of game. In between hearty chunks of feel-good hack-and-slash, you’ll trade a fireworks display worth of projectiles with flying enemies, hack into robot mainframes, read a text adventure or two, and even brawl with a pair of psychotic twins. This radically changing gameplay makes for a thrilling roller coaster ride, and I mean that literally: in one of the craziest, most beautiful action sequences I’ve ever encountered, you’ll fight atop a moving roller coaster while racing full speed through the dilapidated remains of a sun-kissed boardwalk.\nThe radically changing gameplay makes for a thrilling roller coaster ride.\n“\nThe majority of enemy encounters take place on the ground, in sun-dappled pine forests and submerged cityscapes. These seamlessly connected areas offer plenty of space to experiment with Automata’s excellent free-flowing combat, which is where the gameplay shines best and brightest. The system is streamlined into a variety of light and heavy attacks that make it easy to leap, shoot, hack, and slash through giant metal serpents and giant arm-flailing bipeds whose hard knocks can only be avoided through quick thinking and nimble dexterity.\nThere’s no stamina bar holding you back, and the ability to instantly swap out weapons with a light tap of the D-pad means you can go nuts stringing together long attack combos without the need to stop and catch your breath. Developer Platinum does an amazing job of delivering a seamless combat experience, which becomes all the more impressive as things get increasingly frenzied and you find yourself backspringing away from an angry mob in one direction while charging an oncoming panzer controlled by zombie clowns in the other direction.\nAccompanying all the action are hyper-stylized animations of Automata’s cybernetic heroes twirling oversized katanas over their heads and using axes to cut through hostile bits of iron with ballet-like precision. Each battle stance flows elegantly into the next, resembling a crazed version of tai-chi that makes the carnage as fun to watch as it is to play. In fact, combat is such an addicting experience that I often sought out evil animatronics even when they weren’t in my path, just so I could cut them down with a broadsword so massive that in reality it would take three very strong men to lift it.\nAutomata loves to throw out increasingly zany combat scenarios: it’s not unusual to be fighting in an arena full of robotic samurai, tanks, flying metal spheres, and whatever else it can think of to throw at you. Managing all this insanity requires changing tactics on the fly, which is where Automata’s flexible customization system makes itself handy. Upgradable plug-in chips can be swapped out and freely stacked to adjust your androids’ speed, strength, and defenses at any time. Foraging for nuts and bolts in the wild allows you to upgrade your weapons and AI battle pods, while consuming temporary buff and debuffs help to give you a leg up in battle, particularly during Automata’s more punishing difficulty modes. You can even remove chips that provide HUD information for more of a challenge.\nTicking up the difficulty to white-knuckle levels of chaos was a rewarding way to test my combat skills, but it also meant raising the danger in corpse runs, which greatly increased the possibility of losing precious inventory if I failed to retrieve my body. Luckily, if I ever felt cornered I could just hop online and recruit the AI-controlled remains of another player to fight alongside me, or pilfer them for useful items. And if that didn’t work, I could press a self-destruct button to do massive damage to the enemy (and my clothes). I could even wrest control of an opponent’s mind by hacking into their system and force them to demolish their own allies. Unconventional battle tactics? Yup, but they sure are effective.\nThere’s more to do than just stab robots and search for the truth.\n“\nCombat is the heart and soul of Automata, but there’s more to do than just stab robots and search for the truth. Fun money-making enterprises like fishing and hunting are available, and I’m very happy to report that the animal-riding mechanics of the original Nier – complete with car-like drifting capabilities – return. There are also a number escort missions and fetch quests you can do on the side. These missions aren’t always exciting, but they help fill in backstory and reward you with money and rare loot upon completion.\nMy favorite moments, however, were the ones I made up myself. More than once I stopped the action to scale the far-reaching heights of an office building and drink in the sunset, or stood atop a massive tree limb to survey the land below me. These quiet, zen-like moments were a welcome reprieve between bouts of overcaffeinated combat. I loved it, and I loved the game for allowing me to do it.\nAt this point I should note that you do need to wait for Automata to fully download before you play it, otherwise there’s a high probability of coming across a game-breaking bug about three hours in. I also crashed out twice during a couple of particularly intense boss fights, which was a pain in the butt since there's no auto-save and I had to start the battles over again. Still, spread out over 30 hours of gameplay that’s not the worst thing in the world.\nVerdict\nNier: Automata is a crazy, beautiful, and highly entertaining journey full of nutty ideas and awesome gameplay. It may not include the most sensical story or compelling characters, but its frenzied combat -- coupled with beautiful visuals and a stunning soundtrack – make it too much fun to pass up.",

    "title": "Persona 4 Golden",
    "review": "Four years ago, IGN deemed Persona 4 “amazing” on the PlayStation 2. Today, I’m saying the same thing about Persona 4 Golden on the PlayStation Vita. With its slick HD visuals, peppy voice actors and engaging story, the Japanese role-playing game stands among the best titles on Sony’s handheld, but when you toss in how deep the gameplay is and how much there is to do, Persona 4 Golden becomes the stuff of legend.\nPersona 4 Golden is equal parts high school drama and dungeon crawling action. Our protagonist moves to the countryside town of Inaba, makes some friends at school, and – bam – a woman’s murdered. Over the course of the game, the protagonist and his buds uncover a serial killer tossing victims into another world via TV screens, and the group of high schoolers is the only thing that can save the day.\nThink of this as a tale of super-powered, high school-aged detectives. See, the kids are the modern day Monster Squad because they wield Personas, which are kind of like spiritual Pokemon. When a turn-based battle kicks off, the kids can call in a Persona to attack with ice moves, fire punches and so on.\nThat’s the basic line on Persona 4 Golden, but there’s so much more going on. That’s the strength and weakness of the game – it’s dauntingly huge. There are well over 150 Personas to collect, and getting them all will require you to fuse different ones together. Now, when you’re fusing, you’ll need to check the fusion forecast and see what days of the week will get you what Persona bonuses, but then you need to keep in mind your Social Links, too, as those will influence the number of moves Personas get. Of course building those relationships comes down to properly managing your afterschool time.\nThat’s a mouthful, and if you’re just trying to grind out a dungeon, it can be a bit much. I’m not against intricate systems playing off one another, but Persona 4 Golden could do more to explain the ins and outs of what it’s up to.\nBut in the end, that doesn’t matter. Even I, IGN’s village idiot, figured out what books my character needed to read in order to improve his Diligence (one of the five upgradeable traits that influence your conversations) and what people I needed to spend time with to make my Jack Frost Persona more powerful. If a game’s biggest problem is giving you a lot to do and not bogging you down with tutorials, it’s sitting pretty, and Persona 4 Golden is approachable regardless of your JRPG expertise.\nPersona 4 Golden is perfectly at home on the handheld and should dominate your free time.That’s always been a hallmark of the series; anyone can jump in. You don’t need to have played another Persona to understand this one as the characters and setting are brand new. Even though the action is otherworldly, the story is relatable. Trying to make friends, fit in at school and get a significant other are themes we all understand, and that’s why the non-combat stuff is as good as the fighting.\nLiving in Inaba, you’ll attend school and take pop quizzes. You’ll have part-time jobs. You’ll join sports teams and clubs. You’ll choose dialogue responses that affect relationships. The Walking Dead: The Game is getting a lot of attention right now – deservedly so – for giving players choices and allowing them to mold the game into a personal experience. Persona 4 does that; it’s not as drastic as The Walking Dead, but you can tell people off, make bold plays on girls if you’ve built up your Courage, and build your party as you see fit.\nEverything you’re doing in the game is building your character and your party so that when you enter one of the game’s dungeons, which are visually varied and based around the kidnapped character, you’re fighting the way you want to. You’re entering these turn-based encounters where you need to analyze enemies to determine the element they’re weak to and then unleashing the pimped out Persona you’ve been building your character around. It’s a rush to grind and grind only to find that your squad is powerful enough to topple an enemy that used to give you trouble, and that’s a rush you’ll find again and again in Persona 4 Golden – especially seeing as how a playthrough can take 60 hours and then open New Game Plus.\nNow, every lovely thing IGN said in its 2008 review of Persona 4 pretty much applies to Persona 4 Golden – from the detailed rundown of the story to the little stuff like your inability to get tired in a dungeon (you can explore until your heart’s content). But that does mean the game can feel antiquated as it’s 4 years old. You can only save in certain spots, side quests don’t hold your hand like the ones in Mass Effect, and while there are cutscenes, most of the story is told through images, text and some really well done voice work. I find all this charming, but it’s worthy of a heads up.\nIf you’re looking for what the Vita version of Persona 4 adds to the 4-year-old game, we’ve already covered the major stuff with the redone visuals and new lines of dialogue. However, Persona 4 Golden adds some online functionality to the mix, but none of it’s all that newsworthy. At times, a “voice” icon will appear, and you can see how other people have spent their time in the game at that moment. It’s a nice idea, but it’s just a bunch of word bubbles that pop on the screen. There’s no helpful information. Meanwhile, in dungeons, you can send out an SOS and then get words of encouragement from online players and a stat buff at the beginning of the next battle.\nThere’s a new character in the Velvet Room’s Marie who comes complete with her own Social Link to max out and story to investigate. She’s an interesting addition, but I don’t want to ruin her tale for you.\nVerdict\nThe PlayStation Vita is lucky to have Persona 4 Golden. While the game doesn’t do much of note besides bringing the 2008 title to the HD era, it doesn’t need to. The story hooks you, dungeon crawling makes for a great time, and exploring your relationships while building a better army is the kind of tinkering you can get lose hours to. Persona 4 Golden is perfectly at home on the handheld and should dominate your free time.",

    "title": "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion",
    "review": "As the successor to the most popular role-playing trove in videogame history, the PlayStation 3 was in dire need of a good RPG. Luckily, Sony's system took only four months to get one as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion has finally been completed.\n\nOriginally planned as a launch title (and already released to a billion awards on PC and 360 last year), Oblivion is one of the most intimidating games you'll ever find. Enormous doesn't even begin to describe its scale as it dwarfs just about every other competitor in the genre. The number of sidequests and customization options is off the charts and the main quest itself is deep and engaging on its own.\n\nREGARDLESS OF ITS PLATFORM, OBLIVION IS STILL INCREDIBLY HUGE.\nOf course, if you've already played The Elder Scrolls on the other platforms, then its description here is a familiar one. That familiarity makes sense given that the game is practically the same adventure its counterparts were in 2006. Indeed, with few exceptions, the content in Oblivion PS3 is nigh-identical to its brethren in every way. Whether you're playing through the Daedric missions, the Faction quests, the Master Training segments, or the brutal Arena challenges, you're getting what's essentially an unchanged experience.\n\nWell okay, it's mostly unchanged...\n\nSo what's different? For one, the majority of downloadable content available on PC and Xbox 360 didn't make the deadline. That means that Mehrunes' Razor, the Vile Lair, the Wizard's Tower and other post-release goodies are nowhere to be found (and that includes this month's \"Shivering Isles\" expansion). There isn't a clear answer as to whether or not users will ever be able to download these add-ons either -- so there's a definite possibility that what you see is what you get.\n\nDON'T BE FOOLED: THE ELDER SCROLLS ISN'T ALL\nBut what you do get is beyond impressive. Bethesda was generous enough to incorporate its best attachment so far in the form of its 10-hour extra, \"Knights of the Nine\" and unlike previous iterations, you can accept the mission as soon as you escape the first dungeon. But even without this nifty addition, the PS3 version of Oblivion is still a colossal undertaking. There are well over 250 major points of interest in the province of Cyrodiil, and how the story unfolds is completely up to you. It's in this way that The Elder Scrolls is like a true pen-and-paper RPG as it allows you make your own path and tell your own story.\n\nDespite its multitude of user-defined jumping-off points, though, Oblivion's plot and storyline are still very good. But what makes these bits interesting isn't because of any one central theme or direction. No, the narrative here is appealing because of how Bethesda has taken multiple unrelated scenarios and put them together. On its own, your character's quest to fulfill the Emperor's final wishes to seek out his last heir and close the gates of Oblivion is all fine and good, but when you combine that with the excellent Guild storylines and the dozens and dozens of supporting tales, you get something far more compelling. It goes a long way towards creating a believable and completely autonomous world.\n\nAnother attractive element to The Elder Scrolls IV is how user friendly it is. Though the interface may seem a little convoluted at first, its value and mechanical simplicity are apparent by the end of the first hour. Anytime you learn something that could be related to the main quest or otherwise, it's logged in your journal as an easy reminder. If you want to focus on one mission over another, just select it on the screen, mark it \"Active,\" and \"Boom!\" your compass points you in the right direction. Little things like this make tackling the gargantuan world of Tamriel much less cumbersome. When merged with the very handy \"Quick Travel\" option (which allows you instantly move between points you've already mapped), the Journal helps give Oblivion the \"RPG for Everyone\" feel that made it such a hit in the first place.\n\nMOVING FROM POINT A TO POINT B IS SURPRISINGLY EFFICIENT.\nOblivion's character creation system doesn't fail to disappoint either. With a horde of different races, the game gives users control of their destiny complete with lizard people, cat women, multiple elf types, and humans of several nationalities. Each classification has their own inherent abilities and tendencies that work well with different occupations too, and finding strong formulas among them is all part of the fun. You can even create your own unique class from scratch if none of the default jobs tickle your fancy, with numerous modifiers that change the way you work.\n\nAs deep as the creation feature is, though, it isn't perfect. Some of your character's advancement methods, for example, are handled a little strangely. Because Oblivion grants level-gains based on how often you use skills instead of traditional experience points, you'll need to perform the same action over and over again to improve. This means that if you want to increase your speed rating (which is essential for the thief and similar classes), you'll have to spend a great deal of your time jumping up and down (i.e. thousands upon thousands of times). Not only can this get bothersome and tedious, it also looks pretty ridiculous.\n\nIF YOU PICK THE LIZARD, BE POSITIVE YOU WANT HIM (BECAUSE YOU'RE STUCK WITH IT).\nAdditionally, making the wrong character choices can come back to bite you in the Greaves. To Oblivion's credit, you can alter any of the creation choices you've made before leaving the first dungeon (the prison sewers), but once you step out those doors you're stuck with whatever alter ego you selected. In other words, be absolutely sure you want to be the guy you are before walking into the light -- otherwise it can end up hurting your game if you aren't.\n\nTo make it clear, the above criticisms are minor in the grand scheme of things. Even with its faults, Oblivion's sheer depth and multiple storylines overshadow its technical issues and the battle system in particular is great fun. Entirely action-based and playable from a first-person perspective (you can go third-person as well, but the eyes-on approach works infinitely better), the game's combat is both intuitive and effective. Independent buttons are dedicated to offense and defense, while customizable hot keys allow for quick switches between spells and other beneficial powers (which also have their own keys). This layout lends itself well to Oblivion's fast-paced battles and multiple strategies, and the aggressive AI makes things even more interesting. My only gripe is that you can get caught on objects and other structures when battling in close-quarters, but ultimately, it's no big deal and amusement prevails.\n\nOblivion's visual and audio muscles are just as notable as its warfare. Among the best looking PlayStation 3 titles released thus far and a step up compared to the Xbox 360 version, The Elder Scrolls IV shows off what time and fine-tuning can really do. The environments are awesome with wild animals and other creatures moving about in every outdoor location type you can think of. The lighting effects too, are nicely done and most village, equipment, and dungeon types have a look unique to their locality or background. Granted, the facial features and lip-synching are a little \"off\" and there are frequent pop-in problems with the occasional framerate stutter, but for the most part, everything looks great.\n\nMultiplatform users who have been holding out in hopes of getting the \"best looking version\" should still gravitate towards a pumped-up PC. But, as I mentioned earlier, the PS3 version of Oblivion is a definite technical improvement over the 360 edition. Even if you have the latest Xbox patch installed, this newest port holds an advantage with its quicker loading times (which are almost twice as fast as the 360's), fewer framerate hitches, sharper textures, a better draw distance, and a brighter overall picture. Audibly, you're getting the same game -- which, for those of you who are new to the game, is stacked with an excellent ambient soundtrack and strong voice acting.\n\nTHERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT -- OBLIVION IS BEAUTIFUL.\nAnd now for some bad news: Oblivion is glitchy. While not on a catastrophic level, it does offer up some multiple bugs and similar problems that can take away from the experience a bit. Just a few of example include voices changing mid-conversation; NPCs dying without being attacked; characters appearing out of nowhere in bizarre places like the roof of your home; occasional collision issues that allow you walk through a floor or wall; and quest flags don't always activate 100% of the time.\n\nIf the game were smaller in size or didn't offer the hundred-plus hours of gameplay that it does, these glitches would probably be more harmful. But when considering how much fun and replayability you get out of Oblivion compared to how often the bugs appear, it turns out to be a pretty fair trade.\nVerdict\nOver the past year, you've probably already heard how great The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is from PC and Xbox 360 owners, and it maintains that same pedigree on PlayStation 3. There's no doubt that it stands alongside Resistance as the system's cr¿me de la cr¿me even if it does have its own share of bugs and a lack of downloadable content found elsewhere. A must buy for fans of fun games -- no RPG bias required.",

    "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess",
    "review": "Ocarina, your time is up. It took Nintendo almost a decade to do it, but the publisher has finally created a new Zelda game that is so well designed and so epic that it deserves to be crowned the best in its class. Twilight Princess spent four years in development by one of the most talented teams in the world. The game, helmed by Eiji Aonuma (Majora's Mask, Wind Waker) is every bit the culmination of the franchise and also a true spiritual sequel to the Big N's 1998 N64 classic. This is much larger, darker and more difficult adventure than GameCube's Wind Waker, which is sure to please purists. It is also a title that is available on two Nintendo systems - GameCube and Wii. While the new generation version boasts a few extras that make it the better of the two choices, the GameCube original is still no slouch.\nWe could easily write a 10-page review of Twilight Princess, exploring every nook and cranny, detailing every character, every boss, and every last temple, but we don't want to spoil the adventure that awaits you. We realize that the last thing our viewers want with this review is to stumble upon major spoilers, so we've done our best to keep significant story developments and weapon and item upgrades from our critique. That being true, we will be referencing some common themes, characters, previously shown items, temples and more as examples to back up our opinions.\n\nWhen the game opens to a sweeping view of Link as he rides Epona across a vast landscape, you can't help conjuring memories of Ocarina's epic beginnings. And at least for the first half of the adventure, Twilight Princess does indeed feel very much like Ocarina of Time for a new generation of players. Not only does Link start his quest from a small village on the outskirts of Hyrule proper, but he eventually makes his way to cities and temples that have all been seen before - in less detail, of course - almost a decade ago. Were these familiarities representative of the adventure as a whole, the title might find itself with an identity problem. A good identity problem, mind you - even a full-blown remake of Ocarina would be destined for greatness - but an identity problem nevertheless. Thankfully, though, the game also sharply divides the old from the new by way of an engrossing storyline that travels Nintendo's beloved hero into an alternate realm known simply as the Twilight. It is from this beautiful bloom-filled, particle-drowned Hyrulian wasteland that some very different changes are introduced to the old gameplay formula.\nFor starters, Link changes into a wolf and takes on brand new beast abilities. Via some uncharacteristically well-choreographed cut-scenes, the aspiring warrior transforms into the four-legged animal and eventually meets Zelda, who has been imprisoned in the Twilight. He's also introduced to Midna, a pivotal character to the storyline and quest to follow. This is a dark world and it's complemented by a decidedly dark premise. There are no beheadings or, for that matter, even genuine gore, but compared to the always colorful, cartoony affair that was Wind Waker, this stuff may as well be Resident Evil. In one particularly compelling cinematic halfway through the game, the storyline even ponders what might happen if Link himself turned to evil. Nintendo has utilized motion-capturing for characters and the added fluidity is immediately noticeable, but that's hardly the primary reason why these sequences are so welcomed. Rather, the tale has matured and advanced well beyond the templated save-the-princess routine and into something that holds interest not simply to support some well-rounded gameplay mechanics, but as an attraction of its own. As you play, you will generally want to know who Midna is and what here motivation to help Link might be, just as you'll be itching to discover what the true power of the Twilight King.\n\nNintendo's newfound attention to spinning a good yarn seems to clash with its reluctance to join the new millennium and populate its breathtaking worlds with characters whose words are voiced and not bubbled. This, of course, remains a point of heated debate amongst die-hards and we're willing to wager that fans will be copy-and-pasting this very critique to message boards before the virtual ink has dried, but we're not backing down in our assertion that it's time for real, true voice-acting. We understand that Link is a heroic mute and that's fine by us, but the remaining populace has something to say and we don't want to read it. Although the bustling city of Castle Town is the centerpiece of Hyrule, there is an air of claustrophobia surrounding it because the characters never really speak.\nSome gamers have resisted the Wii version of Twilight Princess because they feel that the new control scheme is unnecessary. The GameCube build of the title provides a more conventional alternative that feels very familiar to anybody who has played a Zelda entry before and incidentally as polished as ever. There are even a couple advantages to playing with a traditional controller over the Wii remote. For one, players who enjoyed titles like Wind Waker will understand immediately how to maneuver Link like a pro in Twilight Princess because the same fundamental controls still apply. The character is moved swiftly with the left analog stick and the right opens access to the camera - an option missed in the Wii incarnation. Swordplay is assigned to a button instead of gestures and is easily executed. Drawing and using Link's blade maybe quicker, especially where the spin attack is concerned, but that said the Wii build does facilitate a welcomed layer of immersion made possible by acting out sword slashes with gestures, and that is missed from the GCN build.\n\nWhere the GameCube build comes up short is the area of aiming, whether it's for the Hero's Bow or the Gale Boomerang. Now that we've played through the Wii version of Twilight Princess and experienced pinpoint targeting accuracy via the console's unique remote, it's difficult to go back to the archaic analog stick-based aiming mechanism that the GCN utilizes. Don't get us wrong because it still works just fine. However, in comparison to the Wii remote, it's slow-going and imprecise.\n\nEarly on in the game, Link becomes trapped in the Twilight and - in wolf form - must fight to break free, at which point he returns to his human shape. Later in the adventure, he can switch between the forms at his whim and this mechanic is integrated into level designs and puzzles. Controlling the wolf is similar to maneuvering Link, but the beast form offers you greater speed, the ability to jump at will, a spectacular energy field that encapsulates and destroys the Twilight's enemies (known as Shadow Beings) and sensory equipment. The wolf can, for example, use the sense of smell to find hidden items, see the trapped spirits of Hyrule's inhabitants, and even follow a character's scent. All of these animal powers are not only integral to progressing, but quite a lot of fun in practice, too. Perhaps most importantly, though, is that Midna herself becomes accessible in wolf form and she is able to guide the beast to areas unattainable by Link. As you can imagine, some clever puzzles are based around all the above functionality. By mid-game, Link can also call upon Midna to warp all over the map, cutting down on what could be tedious travel, especially if you need to go back and forth between provinces, as you often must.\n\nTwilight Princess is a gargantuan adventure filled with a dazzling variety of places to see, people and creatures to meet and things to do. The scope of the game is epic and you can play it however you please. For the purposes of this review, we tore through the main adventure and oftentimes overlooked the meaty selection of side quests. We later came back to them and were amazed by their depth. In one corner of the map there is a beautiful, lifelike pond whose primary purpose is to house fish. You could conceivably spend hours upon hours at this location doing nothing but casting your lure. A robust fishing mechanic has been enhanced through the use of the Wii remote and nunchuk and as a result the process of catching a big one is all the more engrossing. In contrast, though, you could speed through the game and never so much as bother with the fishing options. There are an impressive number of other side quests and mini games that follow this same, impressive structure.\n\nWhen Link isn't riding Epona, transforming into wolves, speeding down streams or snowboarding on an ice shard 1080-style over a powdery peak, he's usually in a temple - there are almost 10 of them. Some of these dungeons will seem familiar to Ocarina of Time fans. You will travel to the obligatory lava-filled Goron Temple and you will see the Forest Temple, too. That being noted, these locations are completely changed from their predecessor's counterparts; they're packed with new and clever puzzles, infested with fresh enemies, and just as you will use recognizable items and weapons to traverse them, so will you gain access to brand new ones - a few of them exceptionally awesome. We don't want to go into too many details, of course, so let's just say that Link actually rides one of these new items.\n\nThe complaint could be made that Twilight Princess is too similar to Ocarina of Time because the basic play style is familiar and because some faces and places return. However, we think such criticisms are unfounded because they seem to suggest that Zelda's masterful control mechanics should be changed simply for the sake of being different. These criticisms also ignore everything about the game that is completely new - there's a lot of it. Consider the Twilight Realm, Link's new wolf mechanics, some of the incredible new weapons and items he amasses, and a few of the several original locations and temples, which are fascinating. The Temple of Time is hidden somewhere in this enormous new game, but so is a dungeon in the sky. This is definitely the Zelda universe and yet it is in many ways a compelling re-imagining of that universe.\n\nThe game will test you. When we first played it at length with a group of journalists, we saw a lot of game over screens. We bit the dust a couple times ourselves. Some of the environmental puzzles in the temples are brain teasers, to be sure, as evidenced by the fact that we still have bruises on our foreheads from banging them against a nearby wall. Even so, all said and done we found ourselves hoping for just a little more where challenge is concerned, particularly for boss battles. Although the design and size of these grotesque, awe-inspiring creatures are practically immeasurable, they can usually be bested without ever endangering Link's life force, which is unfortunate. To be fair, some enemies do inflict more damage on Link than others and it is harder to amass hearts than in previous games.\n\nTwilight Princess happens to be a very pretty GCN effort. Although Nintendo's new console is roughly twice as powerful, the visual differences between the two versions of the game are minimal. While both incarnations support a progressive-scan mode, only the Wii build also features a 16:9 widescreen option. Meanwhile, some gamers have complained that the GCN title is riddled with more framerate slowdowns than the steady running Wii game, but we have not encountered these issues while playing.\n\nThe game world is vast and beautifully designed. Nintendo's artists have worked overtime to model the characters and locations that make up Hyrule and it shows. Link features more detail than ever before and many of the enemies that looked quasi-silly in previous Zelda titles are now genuinely spooky. Take, for instance, the Poes -- ghosts which now feature designs that resemble the grim reaper.\n\nThere are definitely visual standouts. The shimmering, realistic water in the game is gorgeous. The Twilight Realm's bloomy art style is equally impressive. And the particle and lighting effects that highlight everything from flowing lava to fights with enemies are second to none.\n\nThen again, this is a GCN title and let's face it, the system is five years old. Some of the textures, particularly those skinning the admittedly immense Hyrule Field, are blurry and even ugly. Nintendo also has an unfortunate tendency to frame cinematics with blurry structures and other objects in the background, which detracts from the presentation. Beyond the low-resolution make-up of some characters and locations, though, we honestly don't have too many complaints, which is quite the feat given that we're self-proclaimed graphics junkies.\n\nNintendo missed a big opportunity where music is concerned, though. The developer consistently creates some of the most memorable and beloved musical compositions in the business and in no franchise are there more memorable and catchy songs than Zelda. Twilight Princess features these wonderful tracks, but the majority of them are MIDI-based and not orchestrated. The MIDI tunes are passable, but they lack the punch and crispness of their orchestrated counterparts. We honestly can't understand Nintendo's decision not to invest more time and resources into the music because Wii discs do not share the storage limitations of GCN ones.\nVerdict\nThe Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is, in my opinion, the greatest Zelda game ever created and one of the best launch titles in the history of launch titles – second only, perhaps, to the at-the-time ground- breaking Super Mario 64. It is also one of the finest games I have ever played.\nAs someone who has played both the GameCube and Wii versions of Twilight Princess, I can confidently state that I prefer the latter for its handful of extras, including what I consider to be enhanced controls and an exclusive 16:9 widescreen mode. That being said, though, I can certainly understand why purists might want to stick with the more conventional controls of the GCN build and as far as a traditional setup goes, Twilight Princess is definitely as good as it gets.\nWhile the game has just about everything going for it, including improved controls, a long and engrossing quest, brain-teasing dungeons and some beautiful graphics, it's not perfect. The difficulty has been upped over Wind Waker, but I wish it were harder still – the boss fights are oftentimes too easy, for example. Additionally, while the visuals are generally impressive, some textures remain blurry to the point they are noticeable. And finally, I still question why Nintendo refuses to add either voice work to the side characters (especially since Twilight Princess features such an improved storyline) or orchestrated music to the soundtrack.\nEverything said and done, this is still a major achievement for Nintendo and it arrives as GameCube's swan song – an epic farewell to what has been a great console.",

    "title": "God of War",
    "review": "Some of the best films of all time are those whose different strengths all work in concert to create a unified, engrossing whole. The Shining, The Social Network, and Jaws are all excellent examples of films made up of strong individual parts complementing each other to form a fantastic work of art. That is absolutely true of God of War – its musical score elevates story moments, which flow seamlessly into fantastic action gameplay, which facilitates exploration and puzzles that reward you with a deeper understanding of its characters and its expansive and beautiful world. God of War is a masterful composition of exceptional interlocking parts, deliberate in its design and its foreshadowing, which pays off in unexpected ways in both the gameplay and story.\nSet in a new, Norse mythology-inspired world and starring a familiar but thoughtfully reimagined character, God of War’s fish-out-of-Greek-water tale is a nonstop whirlwind of emotions. It’s all framed by one continuous camera shot that never cuts away or takes the focus off of the heart of it all: Kratos’ relationship with his young son, Atreus. But the story also encompasses an indelible supporting cast, a gorgeous world consistently rewarding to explore, and immensely satisfying combat.\nGod of War works from minute one thanks to the simplicity of its plot.\n“\nGod of War works from minute one thanks to the simplicity of its plot. Kratos and Atreus – who start as, at best, acquaintances – begin their journey having just gone through the loss of Kratos’ wife, whom Atreus bonded with much more than his father. The two set out to the tallest point in all the realms to carry out her final wishes.The setup is Journey-like in its visual nature – I saw the peak in the distance and knew I’d get there eventually – but as similar stories have taught me, the path is never a straight or easy one. A number of obstacles, both natural and god-made, extend the adventure to around 25 hours’ worth of terrifying threats, beginning with the first major encounter in the opening hours.\nEvery God of War Review\nVIEW 12 IMAGES\nIf you’ve played the previous games in the series – seven of them, counting two PSP games and one mobile game – you know that Kratos lived a long life of loss, triumph, and plenty of god-killing in ancient Greece. While that history certainly informs who he is now, the character we encounter here has started a new chapter, having found love, a family, and a full bushy beard in this world of Norse mythology. But he is still a stranger to this place, and is forced to rely on the son he barely connects with to decipher its languages and guide him when the swing of an axe or the imprint of his boot on an undead foe won’t do the trick.\n\nThat relationship, and how it evolves and changes over the course of the story, is one of God of War’s most captivating qualities. Here are two people with demonstrably different personalities, one of them young and still innocent, the other old and as blood-soaked as they come, both grieving over the same woman in different ways. Kratos loves his son but is cold at first. He seems disappointed in his lack of skill and stomach for combat, referring to him mostly as “Boy,” and rarely making eye or physical contact with him. (He will, of course, unflinchingly beat the life out of anyone who threatens his son, which appears to be the only way he knows how to express affection.) Kratos’ uncertainty of how to relate to a boy he’s both looking to turn into a survivor and yet afraid may turn out like him is devastating to watch.\nSharp dialogue made me see myself in both Kratos and Atreus' shoes.\n“\nTheir dichotomy plays out in stirring, realistic moments throughout the story. I was surprised by how often I saw myself in both Kratos and Atreus’ well-worn shoes. I’ve told important people in my own life some of the very things they say to each other, and I’ve thought (but been too afraid to speak aloud) many others, making God of War’s relationships feel real and cuttingly honest. Other games have tackled parent-child relationships, but I can’t remember a father-son dynamic so successfully developed and used to ground a fantastical adventure.\nThis depth and complexity is something entirely new to Kratos, and this new God of War transforms him from the previous games’ flat embodiment of the bloodthirsty warrior cliche into someone who can stand shoulder to shoulder with some of my favorite protagonists in recent media. He’s now voiced by Stargate SG-1’s thunderous baritone Christopher Judge, who can say so much with a single word or grunt. He gives the long-running character’s stoic dialogue both an intimidating gravitas and nuance you can hear as he grapples with the needs of his son, his internal fears and pain and, of course, the elements and monsters trying to stop him from reaching his goal.\nYou’re Still Young, That’s Your Fault\nGod of War’s single-camera shot style that, unless you die, never cuts once from title screen to ending credits – is a subtle effect that didn’t really strike me at first. But as I explored and fought my way through the story, it served to highlight the power of some of the larger-scale monsters. By never leaving Kratos’ side, I maintained the perspective needed to instantly convey the intensity of taking on a foe 10 times his size. And fear not, God of War still delivers the franchise’s trademark variety of awe-inspiring locations, and the camera helps them shine through in the story’s quietest moments.\n\nAt some of the most tense and heartbreaking moments, the camera never leaves Kratos’ mindstate. You’re forced to sit with him – sometimes in silence, sometimes in anguish as a haunting choir echoes around him, and sometimes in relief – through every second of it. That intimacy makes those emotions all the more real and impactful. It’s made Kratos relatable enough that I’ve been caught audibly referring to Atreus as “my son” several times since the opening hours.\nAtreus’ impact cannot be understated – he’s both an asset to the story and in battle. That’s a huge relief because, historically, games that force you to stick with a sidekick of sorts for the entire experience have been hit or miss. Some, like The Last of Us, use that relationship to smart effect, with twists to the gameplay introduced late in the story. Others make those sidekicks a constant hassle – an extra life bar governed by a sometimes-suicidal AI to consistently worry about in the midst of battle. Atreus is more like the former.\n\nWhat’s so smart about this central relationship, though, is how brilliantly God of War mirrors it onto gameplay from the start. Though the two were estranged, Atreus is still Kratos’ son, and so he listens to your directions and behaves as an almost invulnerable extension of your own abilities in combat. Equipped with a bow and a bottomless quiver of arrows, Atreus will automatically plink away at enemies or jump on them to stun them, and he’ll take a more powerful shot at whatever you’re looking at when directed with a tap of the square button, creating a rhythm as you time taps to match his recharge rate and employ his attacks effectively. His skill tree can also be upgraded to follow up on Kratos’ more powerful attacks. Yet God of War plays with the assumption that Atreus is always at your beck and call, and the weight of the changes in their relationship are cleverly woven into your battles.\nThe Art of War\nAnd there are battles aplenty. Though Kratos only kills for survival now, he still does so with a flair for brutality. The stun-kill animations can be especially gory and literally bone-crunching affairs. (Though, because there’s only one per enemy type, they become somewhat repetitive to watch.) While God of War is altogether more emotionally complex and layered, its excellent combat undoubtedly carries forward the blood-soaked traditions of the series.\nKratos’ signature weapon this time out is the Leviathan Axe, which is one of the best weapons I’ve used in any recent game. It begins with a simple light and heavy attack but can be upgraded and given new abilities throughout your journey. It’s a lot of fun to chop and slice through hordes of foes with, but I’ve rarely enjoyed a weapon more than when the axe is flying through the air.\nThe Leviathan Axe acts just like Thor's hammer, and it's So. Damn. Satisfying.\n“\nIts best trick is that, when thrown, the Leviathan acts just like Thor’s hammer, Mjlonir, as depicted in the Marvel movies. The axe will whip back into your hand with the tap of the triangle button, cutting any foes in its path, both coming and going. It’s also imbued with a frost power that can freeze individual targets while it’s lodged in them, letting you disable one while you beat on his friends with Kratos’ almost-as-lethal fists.\n\nThe feel of throwing and recalling the Leviathan Axe is So. Damn. Satisfying. The first time I learned I could do this, I sliced an enemy through the head and then proceeded to spend a good 10 minutes just chucking the axe and recalling it in the forest, noting and appreciating the slight difference in the time it takes to return from greater distances. The loud, reverberating thwang noise it makes, paired with a precise rumble in the controller, makes the return slam into Kratos’ outstretched hand feel good even hundreds or thousands of throws later.\nFinding the right combination of slicing, throwing, assistance from Atreus, and parrying with Kratos’ retractable shield turns each battle into a bloody ballet of timing – and that’s before you begin unlocking special attacks, like a beam of ice shooting out from the axe or a Patronus-esque wolf Atreus can summon for battle. Though I quickly found my favorites, certain scenarios required me to vary up my abilities by mixing in enemies with immunities and weaknesses. I skipped out on some options in the early game, because options are limited by what you can afford to unlock with XP, but by the latter half I had more than enough to unlock pretty much everything I wanted in time for the most brutal battles. I felt encouraged to experiment.By the end, I’d maxed out every skill tree, including Kratos’ returning Rage of the Gods ability that gives you a temporary boost to damage via a flurry of flaming fists. But those upgrades didn’t make battles a breeze – I still found challenge until the very end, and beyond in my post-game endeavors.\n\nA big variable in combat is Kratos and Atreus’ armor. Chest, wrist, and waist pieces, as well as some tweaks to the axe, can alter a number of Kratos’ stats, from strength and defense to runic magic and attack cooldown rates, and those can have a significant effect on the way you fight. I stayed with my tried-and-true animal hide chest guards rather than full breastplates, sacrificing defense over strength, but would take on new equipment – or outfit them with my amassed slottable runes – to imbue my gear with defenses against certain enemies or to accentuate abilities like my axe’s frost power. I also may have made a few clothing choices based on look because, even though Kratos is no fashion icon, with such intricate character detail I wanted him to stay true to my vision of this embattled man. (And, largely, my Kratos would never wear bulky chest plates.)\nTo the very end, I approached every battle with determination, adapting my fighting and fashion to the variety of enemies, which range from Kratos-sized to sometimes 10 times bigger. I encountered an ice enemy early on against whom my axe did no damage, forcing me to rely on my fists and Atreus’ bow. And the gruesome revenant witch enemy required me to focus on stunning first, as they moved far too quickly for most of my axe hits to connect. That enemy diversity always made me feel like I was learning, up to and including my exploration of some of the optional areas. It seemed as though every time I worried enemy variety might be about to stagnate, a new type or variant would pop up to further complicate my journey.\n\nThe big enemies put up a great fight, like a giant troll who swats at you with a huge club, but some of the best that come from human-sized foes offer a worthy challenge. Most notably, there are a couple of stellar boss fights that, while not terribly complex, do a fantastic job of showing off Kratos’ god-level strength and conveying a feeling of power.\nA Whole New World\nGod of War’s initially linear world opens up a bit after the first few hours, and it encourages exploration through its many rewards and collectibles for completing optional puzzles and fights. But you can occasionally stumble into the path of a much more difficult opponent, clearly denoted by the purple color of their health bar, and they can often take you down in one or two hits. Running into these situations occasionally felt like intruding on someone or something else’s territory, and I needed to be prepared. If I felt hungry for a challenge, God of War never let me down.\n\nThere’s plenty of freedom, although the map never becomes truly “open world” in the way that games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Horizon Zero Dawn are; instead, it’s an interconnected series of diverse locations, many of which are gated behind certain story moments and collectible milestones until the very end. God of War’s contained nature shepherds you through certain locations with its quest chain, which occasionally leans on the cliche of a solution Kratos thought would work turning out to be missing one key component you then need to then go scour the land for. But its world unfolds through smart integration with that story in a manner that occasionally transformed me into a cliche, too. I expected Kratos’ journey to be relatively straightforward and somewhat contained to the area I was initially presented. But then you might stumble on a collectible that extends Kratos’ journey far beyond expectations. Those moments – where I’d find myself traveling further than I set out to and in a surprisingly expansive world, no less – had me literally leaping out of my chair.\nSome of that progress requires straying from the main path, as there are also several major, rewarding areas you can miss entirely if you don’t take advantage of Atreus’ many reminders that you can explore newly uncovered terrain. Both the optional areas and those key to the story not only make smart use of Norse figures and locations, but some are also reshaped throughout the story in ways that make repeat visits valuable and exciting. A variety of collectibles are scattered throughout the world that can earn you tangible rewards, like resources for crafting new armor or new special attacks, or simply offer new tidbits of Norse myth.\nKnowledge of the lore is its own reward in God of War.\n“\nKnowledge of that lore is its own reward in God of War, and I loved hunting down every story thread about the mythology I could find. It helps that these discoveries are often stashed near a beautiful vista or deep in a palpably dank cavern. The fascinating juxtaposition is that Kratos is living through some of the very Norse myths I’ve read about, and so I wanted to explore not just so I could learn the tale of Fafnir the Dwarf but to better understand Kratos’ story.\n\nEven after the story ended, I sunk at least another 10 to 15 hours (so far) into exploring the world. By all indications, I still have a bit left to find, and I want to uncover every inch of it. Quite often when I’m not playing God of War, I’m thinking about caves left unexplored or the tougher foes left unbeaten. Clever environmental puzzles and collectibles have me returning to places I’ve already been many times over in search of new crevices and corners.\nThat’s largely due to how vast and intriguing the world developer Sony Santa Monica Studio built is, but it’s also because of how gorgeous every environment looks. Even during the 10 or so hours I played on a launch PlayStation 4, I marveled at the scenery – how lush the tree lines looked, or how pretty a snowy mountainside looked in the distance. And then I played God of War on a PS4 Pro and was blown away by the true level of detail the world holds when bumped up to (checkerboard) 4K.\nThe Beauty’s in the Details\nI have audibly said “wow” and sighed at the beauty of God of War. The texture of grassy hills in the distance feel real, light dances dazzlingly off of shinier surfaces, and every gnarled monster I have fought conveys such a sense of decay as to instill terror in me. Even the sky looks nearly photo-realistic. And while the beautiful landscapes captivated me, the small details on Kratos and Atreus stunned me. The fur and leather of their outfits move so naturally, and are so finely detailed that they look nearly genuine. I would find myself trying on new pieces of armor just to admire how Kratos’ outfits behaved.\n\nAll of this beauty comes at a cost, however, and that means God of War runs at or around 30 frames per second instead of the 60 frames that makes action games feel so much smoother. That said, the world and its inhabitants largely ran well for me, outside of the occasional framerate dip when swinging the camera over complex scenery or around in the midst of a cramped battle, or while in the “Favor Resolution” Pro mode, which maintains the higher resolution at the expense of dropping some frames here and there. The \"Favor Performance\" mode visibly ups the framerate, but not to 60 fps in my time with it. But the occasional issues in my playthrough never hindered my progress or noticeably took me out of the experience on either the regular PS4 or the PS4 Pro.\nOutside of seeing Kratos’ pores in more detail than you might have expected, that higher fidelity also impacts the performances of Judge as Kratos and Sunny Suljic as Atreus because it allows them to convey so much with their faces. The subtle movements of Kratos’ brow, or the changes in Atreus’ walk when he’s feeling down are so lifelike that I found myself lost again and again in their pains and joys.\nIt features easily one of my favorite supporting characters in years.\n“\nThe two lead actors are elevated by a wonderful supporting cast. A pair of friendly dwarves initially seem like mere comic relief but grow to be integral parts of Kratos and Atreus’ story, with fascinating tales of their own. And the mid-game addition of one key character adds an engaging, hilarious, and heartwarming dynamic to the core duo, transforming this character into easily one of my favorite supporting characters in a game in years.\nEvery God Kratos Has Killed\nVIEW 29 IMAGES\nThe main villains and many of the supporting characters are complex in their motivations, too. Kratos’ (and, by extension, my own) relationship to them transformed in fascinating ways over the course of the adventure. Characters I supposed were merely added for comedic relief turned out to be much more complex, and God of War twists character allegiances and motivations in emotionally relevant ways. And yes, some of those foes are gods, but God of War picks intriguing members of the Norse pantheon, which means we get to see stories of characters other than the popular Thor, Loki, and Odin. While I would have liked to see a few more scenes featuring the main antagonist, the moments involving the big bad are not only captivating but intriguingly mirror the story of Kratos and Atreus, giving nearly every moment deeper meaning.\nGod of War's story revolutionizes a one-note character.\n“\nMuch of what spurs on Kratos and his friends and enemies is the one true motivator behind most deities in ancient mythologies: family. There’s an incredible and clear level of forethought to not only sustaining and expounding on that theme but to making sure the plot, gameplay, and exploration setups early on continue to pay off in new and exciting ways around every corner. I was continually impressed with how consistently something referenced early on in God of War would come full circle later on, perhaps only then to be revealed as the setup for another payoff. Replaying the first few hours, I was astonished at the cleverness of the foreshadowing. And even though I had only just finished the story, I felt the itch to keep playing on this new save.\nGod of War has so much to offer, and you’ll notice I’ve tried to remain as vague as possible in telling you about all of it. That’s not because God of War hinges its whole structure on a twist, or a gameplay trick you’ll never see coming – it doesn’t. But what it does offer is a vibrant, fascinating world packed to the brim with secrets I’m still uncovering, centered around a tale that revolutionizes a one-note character. That sense of discovery is rare, and one that should be experienced firsthand.\nVerdict\nI expected great action from God of War, and it delivers that handily. But I didn’t expect it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect of it complements the others to form what is nothing short of a masterpiece. It’s a game in which Kratos, a previously one-note character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled both on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son; one in which the world opens up and shifts, offering rewards in both gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each accomplishment. The obvious care that went into crafting its world, characters, and gameplay delivers by far the most stirring and memorable game in the series.",

    "title": "Grand Theft Auto IV",
    "review": "Rockstar's vivid tale of Niko Bellic, an immigrant with convictions powerful enough to rocket him through the crumbling substructures of Liberty City's world of organized crime, is now out on PC. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games shipped this past April, and with this one you'll find a few alterations and additions those who waited are sure to appreciate. Despite what's been put in, if you've already played the console versions it's hard to recommend picking this one up, even though it now includes space for up to 32 players in its multiplayer matches and a robust, easy to use replay editor for recording and fashioning clips from your in-game actions.\nThe Grand Theft Auto franchise rocketed to mass popularity after Grand Theft Auto III's release and the ground rules were set for a different style of game. Since then we've seen slight alterations and tweaks to the core formula with Vice City and San Andreas, and Grand Theft Auto IV represents another step forward. This is a game that strips down a lot of the more zany challenges from games past. You won't be doing any remote control helicopter missions or lowrider matching challenges here. Instead, the focus is on realism, a more mature sensibility, and bringing GTA into the present day.\nStarting from dealing with your cousin Roman, a small time operator prone to gross exaggeration, you'll move your way up through criminal rings until you get what you want. Unlike GTA characters of the past, though, Niko isn't trying to prove himself as some sort of badass for the ages, driven to rule the city no matter what. He's looking for something, and the missions he undertakes are really the only way for him to find it. He may perform a number of ruthless acts (which you, by the way, instruct him to), but there are points during the story where you can ease your finger off the trigger or make a choice as to how things proceed. Despite the kind of senselessly violent tendencies many may associate with GTA characters, Niko represents an exception in many respects, as he has a code by which he operates.\nThe game's infrastructure has been made more convenient, though there's still space to improve. If Niko fails a mission, a message asking to retry it pops up as soon as you respawn, and when you die you don't lose your entire arsenal. Getting across the gargantuan metropolis is made easier by hailing cabs that take you to waypoints on your map. Stealing a car and driving yourself is always an option, as is the more immersive element of actually riding in the cab's backseat the whole time, staring out the windows at the passing lights. For anyone who's short on time or would prefer to forego the random dangers of driving across a GTA world, the cabs are certainly welcome.\nStill, you'll be doing quite a bit of mission restarts, and that often means repeating large chunks of the challenges. Many missions break down into an initial travel segment, some kind of escalation event, a conflict, and an escape. Getting through the on-foot shooting sequences, a real headache with the clunky control schemes of games past, has been made much better with the inclusion of a cover system and, as with all PC versions, mouse and keyboard support for aiming and shooting. From behind cover it's possible to blind fire, rapidly pop out to unload a few shots, or move cover to cover, a system that doesn't always work perfectly but is a definite step up for the series. It's possible to use a gamepad as well, which handles vehicles better than a mouse and keyboard. You can even switch freely between the control devices. Juggling the two input methods depending whether you're driving or shooting is pretty awkward, but it's great that Rockstar built it in without forcing you to fiddle with a control input menu toggle. And if you have to pick one, it's far easier to shoot from a moving car with the mouse and keyboard.\nSome of the mission structures can be really impressive and work well in the context of the narrative's direction, but unfortunately the franchise's trial and error nature hasn't disappeared. You could be doing a mission perfectly until you accidentally tap a cop car, inadvertently shoot an item vital to the mission, or misinterpret a new set of directions that require precise timing upon a mission's phase change, and then it kicks you right back out to try again. Some may interpret that as part of the challenge, but it's a setup that's become a little familiar at this point and its continued existence will likely frustrate series veterans.\nThe strength of story and character along with the amazingly detailed world are undoubtedly going to make strong impressions on whoever dives into this version of Liberty City, but GTA has always been about moments. Remember that time you went off the stunt jump and landed on the pedestrian after slamming through the light post with the police chopper crashing to the ground in the background, setting off a string of explosions rocketing through the stalled traffic? With the PC version you'll be able to actually save that sort of thing using the replay feature. Hitting F2 will save a chunk of gameplay roughly 30 seconds long to your hard drive and make it available for use with the integrated replay editor. This suite of tools will let you drop in filters, splice together clips, add text, attach music, adjust camera angles and more so you can recreate your favorite scenes however you see fit. Want a string of shots of you firing at traffic jams from an attack chopper? Remember to hit F2 every time you're in that situation and splicing them all together should be no problem, giving you the opportunity to save and savor those quirky, seemingly impossible-to-repeat moments that pop up in GTA's unpredictable world.\nTo enter into the editor mode Niko utilizes his cell phone, which acts as a sort of hub for a wide range of activities. It comes into play during the course of missions for checking messages and talking with the game's vibrant, well-realized NPC population as well as serving as a tool built to allow players to live Niko's life as if it were a real one. NPCs will call to talk, for instance, with no purpose other than broadening your sense of their character. You can go on dates, organize a game of darts or pool, and manage relationships much like you might outside of Rockstar's world. Many of these diversions turn out to be fairly tedious after a while, but they're entirely optional so you can just leave them alone if you prefer.\nBeyond that there's plenty to discover in Liberty City, a stunningly realized virtual version of New York City caked with all the dust, wear, and dents you'd expect to see while walking down an actual street. There you can engage in the missions, sure, but also immerse yourself in activities strictly frivolous, from heading to Internet shops and clicking through fictional junk mail to sitting back in a dimly lit apartment and absorbing the glut of programs and commercials that, in typical Rockstar style, wryly torpedo popular culture.\nThe series staple radio is very much intact in GTA IV. When set against the Internet and cell phones it seems like somewhat more of an anachronism, but it still delivers the game's fantastic soundtrack and a cavalcade of fake talk programs and sarcastic advertising. Perhaps in GTA V, the protagonist will finally get an iPod.\nPC gamers will get more freedom when it comes to music selection, as Rockstar has included Independence FM with this version. Since you're bound to get tired of hearing about Dragon Brain and Pisswasser eventually, you can load in music files to a game directory that play when this station is switched to, giving you a better ability to find something you like should you decide to go on one of the adrenaline fueled cross-city cop chases GTA is known for.\nThen there's the online play, a major addition for the series and a section of the game that's been expanded with a larger player limit in the PC version and better search functionality. Accessed through Niko's cell phone you'll find a wide range of options for play, from races to deathmatches to a number of team-based games with more specific rule sets. The real draw of the online portion here is to engage in 32 person chaos across the expanse of the metropolis in free mode, but the structured content's there for players looking for something more organized. It would have been nice to see a few extra cooperative modes instead of those already packaged in the console versions, but the multiplayer remains a strong component of this product for the freedom it gives those who venture online.\nOnline or off there's no doubt you'll be impressed with some of GTA IV's visuals. It's not so much the character models, but the sheer diversity of the city's sections, from the glitz of Liberty City's \"Times Square\" to the grime slathered over the industrial areas, Rockstar has produced one of the most authentic, believable settings ever seen in gaming. Yet with the PC version, you're going to need a particularly powerful machine to see it in all its splendor at a decent framerate, as even on our system (Core 2 Quad 2.40 GHz, 2 GB RAM, 768 MB GeForce 8800 GTX with Vista 32) we were having performance problems even after toning down a few of the settings, and some of the effects (the shadows in particular) didn't look so hot when displayed in high resolutions.\nThe sound is implemented even better. Stellar voice acting throughout an absolutely unbelievable amount of sharply written dialogue conveys and illuminates GTA IV's thrilling tale. As you're driving along the introductory sequence of a mission a second time you'll often be treated to an entirely different, cohesive dialogue thread between the passengers of the vehicle and then understand the lengths to which Rockstar has worked to fill this world with variety and personality. But it's also etched into every environment, from the snippets of pedestrians to the ambient horns, train track squeals, and general mechanical fuzz that suffuses big cities that Rockstar's managed to capture so very well here, and contributes heavily to Liberty City's authenticity.\nVerdict\nIf you've so far neglected to enter Grand Theft Auto IV's stunning modern metropolis of Liberty City, by all means get this game. The overall GTA formula has been refined and retooled in this version to be more convenient, more realistic, and ultimately more mature, though it still gets stuck on brambles held over from games past. As far as living a virtual life goes, managing the social network, night life, travel habits and explosive forays of virtual dynamo Niko Bellic is one that'll stick in your thoughts for years to come. The PC version comes with a few added features, such as online filters for finding matches, the ability to save clips and edit them together, added graphics and control options, as well as a larger player capacity in some of the multiplayer modes. Though you'll need a high-powered system to truly experience the PC version's enhanced visuals, Liberty City is still a wonder to behold.",

    "title": "Uncharted: Drake's Fortune",
    "review": "It's been a rough year for PlayStation 3 owners. Exclusives have been lost, a handful of titles have been bumped from the bottom line-bolstering holiday season, and Lair was Lair. With each disappointment, more and more fans have looked to Uncharted: Drake's Fortune -- a title whose screenshots have been lauded for months -- to be the saving grace of Sony's 2007.\n\nBut pinning so much on one title pretty much guarantees a letdown, doesn't it? Can Naughty Dog live up to more than a year of mouthwatering coverage and placate fans who forked over $600 to see stellar title after stellar title come out on non-PS3 platforms?\n\nYes. Yes, it can. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is the most fun I've had in a videogame this year.\n\n\n\nPutting you in the shoes of Nathan Drake -- a worldly treasure hunter on the trail of something big -- Uncharted tosses players into a third-person action/adventure/platforming/shooting homage to the pulp-action movies of yesteryear. Nate takes on pirates, scales ancient walls, swings from jungle vines and solves puzzles using the most basic of clues on his path to unearthing the secrets of his ancestor Sir Francis Drake alongside his cigar-chomping buddy Sullie and newswoman Elena.\n\nUncharted does what few titles manage -- it completely immerses you in its experience. From the moment the game begins with a sweeping camera move through the waters off Panama, a rich score and the words of Sir Francis Drake etched on screen, Uncharted will have you hooked. It'll maintain that hold with its story, style and gameplay.\n\nIf the broad strokes of Drake's treasure hunting story sound hackneyed -- a tough female reporter who hates the hero at first slowly starts to dig him, the older partner's past catches up with him on the hunt of the century, etc. -- rest assured that the possible setback is blown out of the water by the superb dialogue and motion capture from the cast.\n\nI DON'T LIKE YOUR HAIRCUT.\nA lot of times we as an industry like to wax on and on about how videogames rival movies, but rarely do we have an example as well done as Uncharted. Nate is funny as he laments over yet another wall he needs to scale, Sullie is loveable as he tells the same traveler's tales over and over, and Elena's fire for her story and give-and-take with Nate is endearing. When these characters interact and you watch their relationships grow, you feel like you're part of their circle. You feel like they're your friends.\n\nHell, Naughty Dog even went the extra step and made Elena and Sullie non-playable characters that actually help you out.\n\nFrom the first time Elena and I got into it with a set of pirates, she was alongside our hero shooting the bad guys. Mind you, she wasn't softening them up for Drake and she wasn't hiding, she was shooting to death the guys I missed. When Sullie and I were investigating ancient ruins in the heart of the jungle, my former mentor was quick to pull chain levers to open doors for me as well as provide his lighter to enact certain puzzle pieces on our journey.\n\nNon-playable characters with spot-on AI is something we don't see enough of in games.\n\n\nOf course, you're not just sitting around watching Drake, Sullie and Elena's story unfold before you; you are playing it, and thankfully the mechanics here work just as well as the characterization. As you trudge deeper and deeper into the mythos of Sir Francis's series of clues, you're going to bring down more and more heat from pirates and sniper-rifle packing fools hired by Sullie's debtors. When you battle these foes, you'll need to make use of the cover provided by ceremonial pillars, crates and any other jungle spot you can slam your back against and pop out to shoot from.\n\nThe general format for a battle starts with Drake huddled in one spot while the enemies attack -- he'll cringe and duck as the bullets rain down on his position -- and when the bad guys reload, Drake pops out to put a few pistol or shotgun rounds in them. The process repeats until the foes are dead.\n\nIt might sound tedious, but Uncharted tries to shake it up by having enemies come at you from different levels and use different tactics. Some will hurl grenades to try and flush you out, others will flank you, and the big shirtless dudes don't mind running straight at you with their shotguns drawn. The constant variety keeps with the game's fast-paced style even when you're pinned down, and keeping that style consistent is one of the crowning achievements in Uncharted. Whereas lots of games try to have an exciting storyline and then get bogged down with making you nail the mundane, Uncharted gives you a breakneck story and doesn't ask you to sweat the small stuff.\n\n\n\nLook at Tomb Raider. If Lara taught us anything, it's that when exploring temples and other ancient hideaways there are going to be a ton of places you need to leap to, hang from and jump on. When taking Miss Croft through her missions, you have to maneuver her into the perfect position, leap at the perfect time and pray that everything goes right. If it doesn't, she'll fall to her death, you'll curse the heavens and the whole experience will repeat itself until you pass the part.\n\nThat doesn't happen in Uncharted.\n\nSure, there's a ton of ledge shimmying and leaping for Nathan, but our hero is a man who has one hell of a vertical. Although you'll be climbing all over this game, it's rare for you to die while making a move. Uncharted has this action-movie feel to it that could easily be derailed by having you get stuck trying to cross a gap for 10 minutes. The same can be said for the puzzle elements that are often times explained by a quick glance at Sir Francis's diary. Uncharted wants to be a fun, fast adventure. It doesn't want to become a chore.\n\nHowever, that run-and-gun focus might leave a few puzzle fanatics unsatisfied. My first trip through Nate's story took me a little more than eight hours to complete, and I was never stuck at any portion of the title. I mean, I died in a few firefights, but I never had that stalled moment of controller-flinging rage -- and that's a good thing in my opinion. Would I have liked the puzzles to be a bit harder and the game a bit longer? Of course, but the current length works because Uncharted is an adventure that's meant to be played more than once. There are four difficulties to master, 60 hidden treasures to find and 47 medals to unlock for things such as headshots, treasures found and more. These medals yield points, which can be used to unlock additional costumes, unlimited ammo and more in-game goodies.\n\nTHE HELMET ISN'T GOING TO SAVE YOU THIS TIME.\nSome people are going to get tired of the constant stream of rebellious pirates because I know I found myself rolling my eyes when the umpteenth group attacked me. When you've dipped into the black-and-white screen of near death a few times and are running low on shotgun ammo, it's hard to keep your spirits up when the fourth wave of bad guys flood into an area.\n\nHowever, Naughty Dog should be applauded for their decision to stick with the bad guys because Uncharted does a 180 in the final chapters on everything you've known, and it's amazing. Without spoiling anything, the game teaches you to fight and investigate in a very specific manner with its early level hooligans and cover system. Toward the end -- once you've gotten supremely comfortable with the combat -- Naughty Dog flips the system and you've got to improvise.\n\nStill -- as awesome as the flip was -- I could've done with less pirates or a cornucopia of pirates. The point would've been the same, and one of the only dark spots on the game would be removed.\n\nGraphically, Uncharted's beautiful as you tear down trees with turrets, watch Nate's clothes saturate with lagoon water and the sun filter through the leaves, but there is a lot of texture pop-in on the jungle floor and treasures while aliasing on the walls and screen tearing are par for the course. It shouldn't take you out of the experience, but it is noticeable.\nVerdict\nHere's the thing about Uncharted, the final sum is far greater than the individual parts. Maybe you don't dig the combat or maybe the pop-in gets you down, but the overall package of an endearing story, outstanding score, great performances and fun gameplay should put this title on the top of your holiday wishlist. Say what you will about the PS3, but Uncharted isn't just a standout for Sony -- it's a standout for gaming as a whole.",

    "title": "Assassin's Creed II",
    "review": "Assassin's Creed II is the follow-up to Ubisoft's 2007 hit that attracted a mass audience if not unanimous critical acclaim. The sequel is an expansive and bloody romp through Renaissance Italy that plays up every popular aspect of the first installment while righting many of its flaws.\nThe PC and Mac versions ere released months after the game came out on consoles, and much has already been said about the digital rights management issues that have affected the experience since its release. The DRM measures require users to maintain an internet connection while playing Assassin's Creed II in any mode. If you lack a constant, reliable connection, you might want to give this game a pass, even though it's a single player experience.\n\nUbisoft's DRM servers also went down directly after launch, restricting access to new gamers. However our recent experience with the game remained uninterrupted. We did purposefully cut off our internet connection to confirm that the game will pause until a new connection could be established. It does. While disconnected, we were also unable to access the \"bonus content\" from the game's main menu due to an inability to reach Ubisoft's servers.\n\nOnce you get past this strict and inconvenient method of piracy protection, Assassin's Creed II is the same great experience that console gamers enjoyed last year. The two \"missing\" memory sequences that were later made available through download on consoles are available right from the start. PC gamers who have yet to experience this sequel will notice right away that Assassin's Creed II has evolved from an ill-defined action game into a fully featured open world experience. Everything from the new monetary system to the ability to buy armor and weapons makes it a richer, and ultimately more satisfying game than its predecessor.\n\nThe plot of Assassin's Creed pulls together a bit of The Matrix, a lot of historical fiction, and throws in elements of the madcap conspiracy theories found in a Dan Brown novel. The series also has the benefit of being crafted by some of the most talented hands in game development. With only a handful of exceptions, the environments, animations, and art are beautifully portrayed. In addition to its good looks, the sequel's gameplay builds so much upon the foundations of the first game, that in retrospect, the first Assassin's Creed looks like little more than a technical demonstration.\n\nBoth fans and detractors of Assassin's Creed will be pleased to know that the sequel fully addresses and ties up many of the loose ends from the last game. It picks up exactly where we left off, with the kidnapped bartender Desmond locked in his cell at Abstergo. This corporation is the modern-day face of the Templars and they're after Desmond's valuable genetic memories. The magic of modern technology allows Desmond to relive the exploits of his Assassin ancestors. His genealogy puts him at the center of a war between the Templars and Assassins.\n\nThe game starts off with a bang, springing Desmond from jail and introducing him to the Assassins at their secret hideout. Here they have access to the same technology that allows Desmond to relive the past. In the last game, his brain was forcibly used to reveal powerful artifacts hidden in 12th century Jerusalem. This time Desmond temporally relocates to 15th century Italy by choice to learn the ways of the Assassins through the life of Ezio Audituerre de Firenze.\n\nIt's a convoluted setup, but it's also a great excuse to skip around in time, taking control of a character for only the most interesting moments of his life. Players are introduced to Ezio at the moment of his birth as part of a clever lesson on movement. It then jumps to his formative years as a womanizer, a street fighter, and the son of a wealthy banker. He isn't a wholly likable character, but the game steers us towards a revenge plot that provides the player plenty of motivation to stick with the story. The Renaissance setting also adds a much needed dose of color and humor to the series.\nAssassin's Creed 2 Guide\nOur walkthrough, packed with feather, glyph and treasure locations.\nRead the Guide »\nAs we learn more about Ezio and become acquainted with his hometown of Florence, the game presents bite-sized bits of information on how to play Assassin's Creed II. This interweaving of plot and tutorial establishes an intriguing tale of revenge and slowly explains a varied and complicated control scheme.\n\nIn the early missions, we're introduced to the excellent free running system that allows players to climb over almost any surface. Movement speed in Assassin's Creed II has been significantly increased from the first game, enabling players to fluidly zip around the city. The animations are still excellent, and Ezio's body realistically adjusts to his environment as he climbs and vaults past obstacles. The only downside of free running is that there are moments when the camera doesn't present the best view of what's over the next rooftop. Overzealous free runners will take more damage from falling off buildings than they'll ever take from a sword.\n\nThe controls on a PC are fully customizable, but there's no avoiding the fact that this game was developed specifically for a controller. I recommend using the supported Xbox 360 controller over a mouse and keyboard setup to avoid the awkward button combinations required for something as simple as running and climbing.\n\nFor better or for worse \"stealth\" games are defined by the Metal Gear series. Hideo Kojima's vision of tactical espionage has extremely rigid rules about when a player is hidden and when they are plainly visible. Assassin's Creed II breaks this convention, adhering more to the rules of a Jason Bourne movie, where quick actions and a dense crowd are the tools of escape. I find this version of stealth refreshing, more realistic, and ultimately a success due to the numerous options players have when navigating the city streets.\n\n\nThere are still hiding places like bales of hay and roof gardens in Assassin's Creed II. They act as sort of \"safe zones\" that break a pursuers line of site. Ezio can even dive underwater for a limited time to hide from his enemies. But a more satisfying approach to dealing with foes is to divert them with hired help. Thieves, mercenaries and whores can be hired for a fee and directed at targets as living tools of distraction. Players can also toss money into a crowd to cause a small riot amongst the peasantry. This sandbox approach to stealth requires a bit of practice and it won't always result in success, but when it does come together, it's very rewarding.\n\nIf you choose to fight instead of hide, another plethora of options opens up. On the weapon selection wheel, there are swords, daggers, smoke bombs, throwing knives the dual assassin blades, and a surprise weapon I won't spoil. Each weapon has its benefits in terms of strength and speed along with its own slick set of animations. New\n\nweapons can be permanently purchased through shops, or temporarily stolen from an adversary in the heat of battle. Weapon variation has done a lot to improve the variety of combat; late in Assassin's Creed II you'll be looking for a fight instead of turning tail.\n\nEven without sword, the way you engage an enemy has depth. A notoriety meter and enemy awareness indicators being clearly marked on the screen give players fair warning over what sets off the guards. Once engaged, there are sidesteps, special combat moves (like throwing sand in someone's face), and grapples. Novice players will fall back on slamming a single attack button, which quickly becomes repetitive, but experts can turn combat into an art.\n\nThe addition of a monetary system also drastically changes Assassin's Creed II. Ezio receives money as he completes quests, finds treasures, or pickpockets victims. Health will not regenerate completely over time, so medicine and upgradeable armor must be purchased to keep Ezio alive. Besides applying funds to armor, weaponry, and remedies, you also have the ability to upgrade your home base -- a Villa in the country-side. The Villa is something of a glorified display case for all of the collectibles and secret items, but players can also dedicate money to upgrading its appearance and facilities. Rebuild the church and find a treasure; rebuild the blacksmith and get a discount. It's an addictive and optional diversion that completionists will drool over.\n\nThe Villa also gives the game a geographic center and a safe zone to tally your progress. Annoyingly, it's also the only place Ezio can swap weapons and armor, but the addition of travel kiosks mean that players can now be transported to surrounding cities instantly.\n\nThrough the mission structure, Assassin's Creed II guides and nudges players towards the meat of the game. At the start of each mission the player must \"accept\" the task, or put it off until later. The missions that advance the story are always marked on the map with an exclamation point, meaning that a game with plenty of diversions also keeps the main goal visible at all times. It's a good design and a nod to critics of the last game who bemoaned side missions that stood in the way of the good stuff.\n\nIt's difficult to nail down parts of Assassin's Creed II that aren't satisfying. Sections that border on frustrating are either fleeting or optional and some of this \"extra\" content is downright excellent. For example, Prince of Persia fans will revel in the hidden tombs that require dexterity, patience, and expert timing.\n\nEven if you ignore the extras in Assassin's Creed II, the game is still a lengthy experience. The story alone lasts upwards of 18 hours and includes enough variety to be interesting throughout. Not every mission is equally as exciting. The assassinations are far more exhilarating than tailing a target or following an ally through a city. However, there are some one-off missions that are both exciting and wildly different from the core gameplay. With more variety and a tighter focus, Assassin's Creed II gets the pacing just right.\n\nOf course some PC gamers enjoy the benefits of playing at a much higher resolution with crisp, clean textures. Our beefy AlienWare was able to run the game at full settings with only minor stuttering. But while the art direction and detailed recreation of Renaissance is still visually pleasing, it is slightly less impressive when compared to games that are currently pushing graphical boundaries on the PC.\nVerdict\nAssassin's Creed II transforms a middling action game into an intriguing and consistently entertaining open-world adventure. Based on this game, Ubisoft Montreal should run a clinic on how to iterate a franchise and if the series continues in this vein, the next installment will take aim at Rockstar's best efforts. The experience is layered, unique, and shows an incredible attention to detail. This is one case where the sequel has triumphed over the original by catching the gameplay up to the already excellent visuals. No matter what your preconceptions are about Assassin's Creed II, the game is well worth your time and money.",

    "title": "Halo 3",
    "review": "My father once told me, \"Never start a fight you don't intend to finish.\" Master Chief's pappy must have said something similar to him long before John-117 became a Spartan, because in Halo 3, the iconic action hero does indeed finish the fight. There is no cliffhanger ending that will have you screaming at your television, no doubting that this is Chief's tale and everyone else is along for the ride, and no question that it is a worthy conclusion to the most successful trilogy in videogame history. But just like that girl you dated in college, Halo 3 has some issues. Don't' worry; the good far outweighs the bad. This is Halo 3, and it is indeed the game you've been waiting for the past three years.\nWhen last we left Master Chief, he was headed towards Earth, determined to stop the Prophet of Truth and his cadre of Brutes from destroying the universe in a blaze of zealotry. Cortana had been captured by the Gravemind, a disgusting creature intimately tied to the Flood. The Arbiter and his Elites, once bitter enemies of humankind had made an uneasy truce in order to conquer a greater evil. Frankly, things didn't look so hot for Earth and its inhabitants. For three years fans have been waiting to find out what comes next. Most won't be disappointed, as the story eschews some of the ambiguity of Halo 2 and tells a more straightforward narrative. Events play out like a sci-fi action blockbuster.\nLost, though, is the intriguing side-story of the Arbiter and his Elites. The focus is clearly (and perhaps deservedly) on Master Chief. That means in the single-player campaign you will be Chief and Chief only. The Arbiter is just a dude with a weird mandible and a cool sword. While keeping players locked in as Master Chief is a wise decision on Bungie's part, it's a shame that the Arbiter's story fades so far into the background. That's not to say I want to spend half the adventure following the Arbiter and leaving Chief to twiddle his thumbs, but it would have been nice to see such a prominent storyline from Halo 2 have more weight in the cinematic telling of Halo 3.\nClearly Bungie was listening to the criticisms of Halo 2. Not only is Chief in the driver's seat once more, but the environments are varied enough that each level feels distinct. Though you will still need to backtrack in a few areas, it's not as tedious as in previous iterations. The levels in Halo 3 lend to spectacular pacing that weaves from close-quarters, intense battles with Chief and a few soldiers, to more epic arenas. It does feel as if the marine presence is lighter than it should be, but there's enough chaos in the field to at least make it appear as if Master Chief is part of something grander.\nimageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F821%2F821911%2Fhalo-3-20070923064634599.jpg&caption=You+can+rip+a+turret+from+its+mounting+and+take+it+with+you.Most of the nine levels are hunky-dory, but the penultimate chapter is so bad, just thinking about it puts a rotten taste in my mouth. It's the kind of level where, if playing through Halo 3 again, I might just stop once I reached it and not bother finishing the skirmish, much less the fight.\nIt should be noted that the difficulty level is a bit out of whack, though done purposefully. Bungie has to service an enormous casual crowd who (let's face it) suck at games. There are millions who will play Halo 3 and only Halo 3 this year. All they want is to finish the fight and take a nap on the couch. But at the same time, there are an equal number of hardcore gamers who have become immensely skilled at Halo over the past six years. For these folks, the single-player version of Heroic and Legendary difficulties has been ratcheted up just a tad. Many will immediately jump into Normal difficulty, and never see the more aggressive AI that calls in reinforcements and makes better use of its weapons and equipment. Frankly, Normal on Halo 3 is too easy for the average gamer and that lack of challenge may actually bore some.\nDo yourself a favor and test your mettle on the harder difficulties right off the bat. Once again, the Halo franchise utilizes some excellent AI that shouldn't be missed. The Brutes, now the primary focus for your aggression, have a distinct hierarchy and their actions are generally dictated by rank. The Brutes also make liberal use of the new equipment system. By pressing X you can deploy one of several different pieces of equipment that offer a momentary offensive or defensive advantage. You'll often enter a fracas and see a Brute deploy a Bubble Shield (a transparent dome invulnerable to gunfire) or a Regenerator that creates a green cloud which continually heals those within its radius. By their nature, the Brutes are aggressors and can be coaxed from the safety these beneficial pieces of equipment provide. While I wouldn't go so far as to say no two battles are alike, you will certainly illicit some different responses depending on the actions you take.\nThe enemy AI is generally solid, but the same can't be said for your teammates. It's been said that the world would be doomed without Master Chief. After seeing the other marines in action, that makes a lot of sense. The AI drivers are less like marines and more like Mr. Magoo; support troops are just fodder for the Brutes; and the Arbiter makes me question why the Elites were ever feared in the original Halo. Let's get the Arbiter clear. He's the bad ass \"Chief\" of the Elites. He should be able to handle his own. In the campaign, the Arbiter and Master Chief are BFF. If you play alone, the AI takes control of the Arbiter and allows him to tag along. Enjoy watching your supposed equal getting shot in the face repeatedly and generally making himself utterly useless. What is the point of sticking you with an AI compatriot if all he's good at is respawning?\nimageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F821%2F821911%2Fhalo-3-20070923064637099.jpg&caption=You%27ll+face+a+variety+of+Brutes+in+Halo+3.While Heroic and Legendary single-player offer a good challenge, the same can't be said for co-op. A decent Halo player can get through the campaign alone on Heroic in 10-13 hours. Four decent Halo players can burn through Legendary in 4-5 hours easily. Unlike Halo 2, you aren't penalized for having a teammate die. As long as you aren't amidst a swarm of enemies, your dead buddy will respawn, whereas in Halo 2 if either player died, you were forced to restart from the last checkpoint. But don't worry, Bungie has set up an interesting system to add a bit of challenge and replayability to co-op for those who don't want to be able to obliterate the enemy with ease.\nA few truly adventurous souls discovered that there were skulls hidden in the levels of Halo 2. Those skulls were not only hard to find, but often hard to reach. And they could only be acquired in Legendary. The skulls make a return for Halo 3, but have been re-imagined so as to be more accessible to gamers and to make replaying Halo 3 more interesting. The skulls (most of which can be found at Normal, Heroic, and Legendary difficulty), can be activated before a level to increase the intrigue. Most of the skulls make things a lot tougher. One removes your HUD and reticule, another empowers enemies with incredible grenade skills. Some, however, are just for fun. The Grunt Party skull, for example, offers confetti celebrations for head shots. Throwing a fiesta for popping Grunts is an excellent way to assuage a hangover. Well done, Bungie.\nimageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F821%2F821911%2Fhalo-3-20070923064632146.jpg&caption=You+are+one+ugly...The skulls play a role in the new optional scoring system. In co-op you can turn on scoring to earn points for kills and other key actions, allowing you to compete for the best score against your teammates. Ultimately, your Metascore doesn't mean a whole lot, except to your ego. Still, both Halo and Halo 2 are games that people continue to play to this day. And it's the little extras, like the Metascore, that add longevity. Even when you've finished the fight, you'll want to start it all over again. Especially if it means jockeying with your buddy (either online or offline) for a chance at bragging rights.\nThe meat of Halo 3 is its multiplayer. Let's be honest with one another: There's nothing Bungie could do to make everyone happy. And since it's tough enough for me to be ensure my own happiness, I can't really address the individual concerns of the millions who will hop online from September 25, 2007 and play through September 25, 2010. So let's talk about what makes me happy. Halo 3 strikes a nice middleground between the the multiplayer of Halo 1 and Halo 2. For the most part you get the best of both worlds.\nThe battle rifle has become the default kick-ass weapon of the Halo universe, the M16 of the 26th century. But there are few weapons that, in the right hands, can't put someone to death. There are a few casualties to the tweaks made to weapons. The submachine guns are pretty much obsolete next to the more powerful (and cool) Brute Spikers. And all guns still fall short of the power of a well-placed punch to the back of someone's skull.\nOne of the more surprising improvements falls to the Energy Sword. Less prevalent in the campaign, the Energy Sword has a new twist in multiplayer. If two opponents swing swords at the same time, the two will clash, momentarily stunning one another, but leaving both alive. It then becomes a furious battle to see who can get in the killer strike as the two clang swords in a clumsy form of swashbuckling. A quick-jab strike with the melee button can often result in a win in such contests. While it's not Soul Calibur, it adds enough of a wrinkle to make Energy Swords seem fresh again.\nimageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F821%2F821911%2Fhalo-3-20070923064635177.jpg&caption=Welcome+back+to+Zanzibar.Several swank new weapons have also been added to the arsenal. There's the powerful Spartan Laser, which can practically cut Warthogs in two; the Ruthian Gravity Hammer, which allows you to swat vehicles to the other side of the map; and the aforementioned Spikers, that, when dual-wielded, can bring a quick death to enemies at close range. While all of the new weapons are fun, one stands out. There really is nothing quite like seeing a Spartan walk through a door toting the hefty flamethrower. If you're online and hear a dulcet-toned IGN editor ask, \"How you like your ribs,\" prepare to be barbecued.\nThe Gravity Hammer and Spikers can feel overpowering at times, but there are limitations to all of the weapons in Halo 3. If you're sick of being knocked 30 feet in the air by a Gravity Hammer, keep your distance from the guy who talks softly and carries a big stick. Besides, balancing weapons doesn't mean they are all equal. It means there is a cost for power -- usually in aim, or recoil, or range.\nReally, the multiplayer boils down to one question: Is it fun? Yes. It's a lot of fun. And that's all Bungie needed to do. Create a multiplayer that's fun and addictive and that will satisfy the majority, even if it doesn't necessarily please the vocal minority.\nAlso added to the mix are some new vehicles. Bungie didn't go overboard by inundating Halo 3 with too many new rides, but there are a few sweet ones. The best of the bunch is the Brute Chopper. If the Fonz followed the Prophet of Truth, this is the bike he would ride. It's fast, maneuverable, and very deadly. It is perhaps more powerful than it should be, but when a vehicle is this cool, you almost need it to be king of the battlefield. The bad guys don't get all the fun toys. The UNSC Marines are given access to the Hornet, a futuristic VTOL aircraft that's likely to see limited use in multiplayer, but is still fun to toy around with. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention my personal favorite: The Mongoose. This two-person dirt bike has no offensive capabilities, but it can drive your opponents nuts, thanks to its speed. There's nothing quite like driving circles around the enemy while mocking them.\nimageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F821%2F821911%2Fhalo-3-20070923064631333.jpg&caption=Sandtrap+is+one+of+Halo+3%27s+best+maps.Halo 3 ships with eleven multiplayer maps, though more are expected through downloadable content over the next few years. This is the series' strongest collection of maps to date. There's an excellent variance not only in range, but in layout. The majority of the maps service both long-ranged and close-ranged combat. While larger, more open maps -- such as the desert-themed Sandtrap -- offer the chance for snipers to get in their licks, those who prefer to get their kills up close will find it's possible to stay out of the open and clean up with the shotty. Snowbound and Isolation are both examples of maps that have open upper levels, but more confined subterranean areas.\nIf you don't dig the layout of a particular map, you can make some adjustments with the Forge. This new addition to the Halo series will keep these eleven maps fresh for years. While you can't alter the geometry of the level, you can make any other adjustments you wish in the Forge. On your own, you can hop into any map using The Forge and rearrange the placement of objects, weapons, power-ups, spawn points, and objectives. You can also access a Counter Strike-style menu and spend money to drop new vehicles, equipment, objects, and more anywhere you like in the map. Then you can save the new map you've created and upload it to Bungie.net for others to check out.\nBut the Forge offers much more than just some map-editing tools. You can also play games in the Forge while the map is being edited. When you decide to edit, your player transforms into a monitor (a la Guilty Spark). Change to the monitor and zip away from a firefight. Or buy yourself a rocket launcher and drop back in the middle of a fight ready to blow away the competition. Depending on the settings you choose for The Forge, you could potentially have a dozen players manipulating the surroundings. Perhaps you'll form teams of two, where one person plays the monitor, dropping supplies for the other player. Or you could have the host act as a sort of Dungeon Master, changing the location of items as a Slayer match roles on. There are near limitless possibilities. You don't even have to fight to enjoy the Forge.\nimageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F821%2F821911%2Fhalo-3-20070923064632661.jpg&caption=Looks+like+a+Killing+Spree+to+us.As a prime example, four editors from competing websites met to test out the Forge recently. At first, we spent some time fragging one another and learning nifty ways to manipulate the system to gain the upper hand on our opponents. But within an hour, we were joining forces to create the biggest pyrotechnics show ever witnessed in Halo. We stacked every possible explosive, then discovered a way to cause one canister to respawn in the air, falling into the pile every 30 seconds to create a spectacular explosive display. The result was a repeating series of massive explosions, which created a unique new environmental danger during firefights.\nIf you take the rich gametype customization (as previously seen in Halo and Halo 2) and then add the Forge into the mix, you can see how Halo 3's multiplayer has a near limitless number of permutations. While the casual fan may not find much interest in building their own versions of maps and gametypes, this will keep some of the more serious gamers playing Halo 3 for years without getting bored. And, again, all of this can be quickly uploaded so that others can check it out. The online elements of Halo 3 are above and beyond anything we've seen previously in a console game.\nBy now you're frothing at the mouth thinking of the thrilling battles in the campaign, of blasting people online with all the cool new weapons, and mucking around with the Forge. Now imagine if you could keep a visual record of everything you ever do in Halo 3. It's not only possible, it happens automatically. Every time you play Halo 3 -- be it a campaign level, Forge, or multiplayer -- the 3D game data from your match is saved to your hard drive or memory card. The file is only a few megabytes, but you'd never guess it from the replays you witness.\nimageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F821%2F821911%2Fhalo-3-20070923064633146.jpg&caption=Moments+before+all+hell+breaks+loose.Let's say you pull off the particularly amazing feat of launching your mongoose off a man cannon (a propulsion device in some multiplayer maps) and as you pirouette in the sky, you manage to snipe an enemy who's rocket has just whizzed past your head. You're no wordsmith. And, more importantly, you're friends know you could never pull off this insane headshot you're trying to describe. Now you have footage to prove there's no fiction behind your greatest deeds. You can go back to that match, pause just as you snipe, detach the camera from your character, and pan around the scene. You'll see the smoke trail of the rocket, and can follow the path of your bullet right through your victim's skull. This can be recorded and uploaded to the one you sniped or anyone else that has a copy of Halo 3.\nYou can watch your complete tour of the campaign. Want to see a Scarab explode in slow motion? Easily done. Want to see what the AI is doing while Master Chief is running other folks over with a Warthog? Yeah, you can do that too. The replay system is truly amazing, groundbreaking, and undeniably cool. It really is the very best thing about Halo 3. I've watched plenty of replays at this point, but it still has me in awe every time.\nThe replays also create a greater appreciation for the beauty of Halo 3. This is a gorgeous game that has such a quick pace, it's easy to miss out on some of the things it does well. Pause during any explosion and fly the camera by to view a marvelous shot. The particle effects are truly top notch. It never fails to impress. There's the smoke and dust from the back of the Brute Chopper, the blinding red bolt of the Spartan Laser in action, the subtle shine of Master Chief's armor. Considering that Bungie had to have every nook and cranny of the environment detailed and rendered constantly (because you can detach the camera for replays), Halo 3 really is a marvelous technological achievement. It may not be the prettiest game on Xbox 360, but it's also doing far more than any other game. For that, I can forgive the occasional moments when the framerate jitters or there's some minor texture pop in. I get texture pop in just trying to butter a bagel.\nimageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox360media.ign.com%2Fxbox360%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F821%2F821911%2Fhalo-3-20070923064633896.jpg&caption=Cool+explosions+are+commonplace+in+Halo+3.\nThey say to save the best for last, which is why I've neglected to mention the sound until now. Were it not for the excellent sound effects and the top notch score, Halo would not be nearly as good of a game. When Master Chief is about to enter a major battle and the music sweeps in, it's impossible not to feel a sudden surge of adrenaline. Halo's combat theme is the perfect futuristic military anthem. How could you not bring your A game after hearing that evocative orchestral powerhouse? I can't stress enough how vital the sound is to this franchise. The score is powerful, cinematic, and at times moving. It's the music that humanizes a hero who wears a helmet 24/7. For my money, Halo 3 has the best soundtrack of any videogame.\nVerdict\nThe campaign, which is very good, is Halo 3's weakest point. It doesn't capture the cavalier spirit of the original Halo, but you'll still have fun playing through it. There's no first-person shooter on 360 that can equal Halo 3's blend of cinematic action, adrenaline-pumping shootouts, and male- (and female)-bonding gameplay. Look beyond the gameplay and you have a rich feature set unlike anything ever delivered in a videogame. The Forge and the replay functionality raise the bar for console shooters so high, it may never be surpassed this generation. There will be plenty of aspects for fans to nitpick, but it's hard to argue against Halo 3 as the most complete game available on any console.",

    "title": "Mass Effect",
    "review": "In many ways Mass Effect could easily be an incredible Star Wars role-playing experience. After all, it has all the elements of that classic space opera, like memorable aliens, killer droids, and a special order dedicated to maintaining balance throughout the galaxy. Plus, there is the tiny little detail that BioWare has a history with this sort of thing. However, if it were a Star Wars game then Mass Effect probably wouldn't be anywhere as interesting or cool as it is. That's because discovery has an excitement all its own, and Mass Effect introduces us to a deeply immersive new galaxy full of stories and mysteries.\n\nFirst, here's a disclaimer: I played Mass Effect on the Xbox 360 last year and it was an excellent and engrossing game then. The PC game is identical in terms of content, and yet I still found myself engaged and enthralled by the universe. In fact, I caught quite a bit that I missed on the Xbox 360 with the PC game, like a number of side quests that I never knew existed. So if you've already played the Xbox 360 game, there's still plenty to discover in the PC game, plus you can enjoy higher resolutions, faster load times, more save slots than you can shake a stick at, and the precision of the keyboard-and-mouse controls, to just name a few benefits. And if you haven't played Mass Effect, then you need to.\n\nYES, YOU CAN GO SIX-WHEELING ON THE MOON.\nThere are so many reasons why Mass Effect is so appealing. It's got a typical BioWare plot, which means that there's a mystery that's so well thought out and told that everything clicks into place during the big reveal. Yet it's also a game made by sci-fi fans for those who love sci-fi. There are so many elements borrowed and culled from decades of science fiction and movies, and there are countless moments that will remind you of Star Trek or Aliens or Firefly or some early John Carpenter movie (the electronic score is very Carpenter-esque, too). There's even an effective film grain post-processing effect that makes the game feel like a 70s or 80s sci-fi movie, before digital filmmaking and CGI made everything look and feel too clean.\n\nHere's the premise of Mass Effect: Several hundred years in the future humanity has joined the galactic community after finding alien technology on Mars that opens up interstellar travel. We uppity humans are seen as too ambitious in a galaxy run by a UN-like council populated by ancient alien races. You play as Command Shepard of the human Alliance military, and BioWare lets you role-play as either a male or female character. There are pre-rolled characters that you can select or you can create a custom character with a unique face.\n\nWhen a rogue spectre--one of the galactic council's special agents--attacks a human colony on Eden Prime, you're tasked with hunting him down. It's not that simple, though, as invariably epic themes such as extinction on a galactic scale kick in. So you must zip around the galaxy in a very sleek starship, explore alien worlds, engage in futuristic firefights, and unearth the overarching mystery. There's also a cast of human and alien characters that can grow on you, like Wrex, a krogan killing machine with a blunt, sardonic personality. And this wouldn't be a BioWare game without one or two romance possibilities, as well.\n\nTHE NEW TACTICAL COMBAT INTERFACE IS USEFUL.\nMass Effect's story goes beyond just simple character interaction, though. You have a wide degree of freedom to see how your story unfolds. BioWare offers basically two paths: the path of goodness and decency (the paragon) or the path of ruthlessness (the renegade), and often the choices presented to you can get under your skin. The game does an incredible job of introducing you to sympathetic characters whose fate you later get to decide. These can include members of your very own party to large numbers of innocents that you meet along the way.\n\nThis is also a game about exploration and combat, as you'll explore vast facilities on foot, drive around alien landscapes in an all-terrain vehicle, and engage enemies using a variety of sci-fi weapons and armor. Here's where the PC game improves on its Xbox 360 cousin, as it features a new tactical combat interface that lets you give individual orders to your two squad mates. There's also a useful quick slot toolbar that you can drag-and-drop special abilities to, letting you access them with a tap of the keyboard. This translates into greater tactical control during combat. The precision of the mouse and keyboard helps to a degree, but this isn't a pure action game, so it doesn't matter if you can put the cursor directly on a target. What matters more are your character's stats and the stats of the weapon that you're using. Still, I was able to get through many battles on the first attempt, which is in contrast to my experience with the Xbox 360 game, where I died-and-reloaded in many of those same battles multiple times.\n\n\nThe combat system of Mass Effect is dynamic and deep. You can play through as a soldier, which makes it not unlike a third-person shooter where you have to use cover to shield yourself from enemy fire while popping out to shoot back. However, the other classes in the game let you tap what are called biotic and tech powers. You or your allies can use abilities such as singularity to send enemies floating in the air, letting you unload into them. (There's physics in the game, too, so pounding an opponent with enough force will send them hurtling through space.) Then there's the intricate weapon and armor system, with upgrade slots for almost everything, including different types of ammunition. At the same time, if you're not an action fan or you lack lightning-fast resources, Mass Effect is fairly forgiving, as you can pause the action at any time to issue orders to your teammates or you can tweak the game settings to give you a generous aiming reticule.\n\nIf there's a complaint about Mass Effect, it's that many of its side quests recycle the same formula: go to planet X, land in the Mako rover, roll around the landscape until you find the objective (which usually recycles the building design from previous missions), go in guns blazing, and you're done. There's not a lot of variety here, but to its credit Mass Effect makes these detours fairly quick, so it's not like you're getting bogged down by them. And while the game finishes on an excellent note, it feels like it finishes too soon. BioWare has made no secret that this is just the opening chapter of a Mass Effect trilogy, so the company has sprinkled potential future plot threads throughout the game. And maybe it's just me, but it seems that BioWare's games used to be longer than Mass Effect. For instance, Mass Effect's main plot would have constituted but a chapter in Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights. So for better or worse, Mass Effect will most likely have you wanting for more.\n\nREMEMBER, EVERYONE FIGHTS, NO ONE QUITS.\nThere's a built-in timer in Mass Effect, so I know that it took me 19 hours and 9 minutes to get through the entire game. Of course, I had played Mass Effect on the Xbox 360, so I was able to blitz through the story for this review. If you approach the game at a more leisurely pace and take time to do more exploration, there's easily another 10 or 15 hours of gameplay here. There's also a considerable amount of replay value, too. In fact, the game encourages it, since you can beat the game and then start a new one using the high-level character you just used to finish the previous game with. This means that you get all the experience and skills that you finished with, as well as all the weapons and equipment that you have. Or you can roll a new character and explore different story paths. (There are unique quests depending on what you choose for your character's background or if you strive to be a paragon or a renegade.) Finally, there are a slew of achievements that you can work toward, but unfortunately these aren't Games for Windows -- Live achievements, and that means that they'll have zero impact on your overall gamerscore if you're a points hound.\n\nAs you'd expect, the PC game looks quite a bit sharper than its Xbox 360 cousin, provided that you have the hardware for it. I played on a dual core system with an Nvidia 8800GTX card and it looked incredibly sharp at 1680x1050 resolution. The frame rate was fairly steady, too, though there was the occasional hiccup now and then. I was surprised to see how much of a CPU hog it is, as both cores on my processor were constantly maxed out whenever I played. The PC game doesn't really feature any graphical enhancements, and it uses the same textures, but it still looks better on the PC screen than it does on an HD television. And the texture popping problems exhibited in the Xbox 360 game were pretty much missing from the PC.\n\nThis is also an excellent sounding game, especially on a surround sound system. The voice acting is simply superb, as the large cast brings an incredibly varied range of characters to life. In fact, voice acting doesn't get much better than this. There's the occasional familiar voice, like Keith David as a famous captain or Lance Henrikson as an admiral, but for the most part BioWare enlisted a large number of professional voice actors to deliver the lines for many memorable characters. Moreover, it isn't just the performances but it's also the quality of the material the voice actors had to work with. Key NPCs have moving stories to tell, stories that tie into the overarching history of the universe. The music is also powerful and haunting, as the electronic themes capture the desolate and lonely nature of space, but they're also capable of ramping up in urgency during battle.\n\nAH, SUNSET ON A PLANET WITH A POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE IS SO ROMANTIC.\nMass Effect doesn't feel like a port, so don't hold the fact that it arrives six months after the Xbox 360 game against it. The interface feels like it was built for the PC, and there are a slew of improvements here that the Xbox 360 game will never get, like an improved inventory system. It's also nice that there are pretty much as many save slots as you need, which is a big improvement over the Xbox 360 game. In that version you frequently had to overwrite previous saves, which made going back to experiment with different story paths difficult.\nVerdict\nIt almost goes without saying that BioWare remains one of the very top single-player RPG makers on the planet, and Mass Effect only reinforces their position. This is easily one of the best RPGs on the platform in recent years, delivering a terrific new universe, a fun blend of action and role-playing, and a deeply satisfying story. If you have any love of science fiction or space opera, then you owe it to yourself to check it out. There are hours upon hours of joyful discovery here, and an undeniable love for science fiction, as well.",

    "title": "The Sims 4",
    "review": "After a decade of updates, including going free to play, we've updated our review to reflect the current state of The Sims 4 in 2024.\nOver the past week I’ve become intimately familiar with the virtual life of a geeky tech-industry maven named Jess, who I gave wide, swishy hips and a sly smirk. As of this writing, she has completed the level 10 programming skill, felt sad once and happy 232 times, WooHooed only nine times, and had two kids with the husband she met at a bar. I’m having a hard time saying goodbye to her, admittedly, so I have her drinking anti-aging potions. I encounter this problem with a lot of Sims games, and this time it’s even worse (because a lot of things are better). But at the same time, The Sims 4’s lack of features and small world hasn’t let Jess live her life to the fullest. Even though it’s fun, it’s a big letdown that this sequel doesn’t inspire the same wow factor that The Sims 3 did when I first played it years ago.\nWhen I created Jess, I was immediately impressed by the appearance-customization options. Picking a Sim’s walk style, which can vary from “tough” to “feminine,” does a lot to express personality (and it’ll change to a slouch if they’re tired or an “I have to pee” walk when their bladders are uncomfortably full). The new Create-a-Sim in general is really intuitive, allowing you to push and pull at different parts of a Sim’s body in order to get the exact size and shape you’re looking for. I’m a huge believer in body positivity and beauty in all bodies, so seeing more realistic representations of various body types was really encouraging. I gave Jess thick thighs and hips and kept her upper body lean, because I finally could.\nI was disappointed, however, that I could give her only four total traits — three, if you don’t count the trait associated with her lifetime aspiration. That’s one fewer than The Sims 3 allows, or two if you have the University Life expansion. It turned out to be less of a problem than I’d imagined, though, because the addition of emotions makes a lot out of a little.\nTrying to get Jess a date was my first brush with the new emotional axis to Sims’ personalities, a system that successfully supplants traits as a more realistic way for Sims to live and interact. I quickly learned that Jess, who I gave the “romantic” trait, very easily swung into “flirty” feelings. Feeling flirty unlocked several fun interaction options, like posing seductively or taking a cold shower to quell thoughts of WooHoo. (Pro tip: Use some of the flirty options before jumping straight to WooHoo. In the spirit of realism, Sims will get a better mood boost from it afterward.) On the other hand, going too long without flirting made her “tense,” which opened up another set of actions.\nThat’s the best thing about emotions in The Sims 4: They provide new contextual opportunities to Sims, like being able to tell a self-deprecating joke when embarrassed, and make a lot more sense than just having static interactions based on personality traits. It was a lot of fun to watch an energized Jess “mop like mad!” and kind of touching to see her inspired husband tell her about his dreams. It took me about 15 hours of playing with my crew of Sims to fully appreciate the complexity of Sim emotions, but now I’m really enjoying it.\nOf course, to get the most out of these interactions, you need to socialize, and to socialize, you need to leave the house. That’s why I’m so extremely disappointed with The Sims 4’s small, stifling world – every trip, even to a next-door neighbor’s house, brings up a short but jarring loading screen. It feels like a high-res version of The Sims 2, at least in this sense. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it is a shock to the system after exploring an entire town seamlessly in The Sims 3.\nExacerbating that, there are only 10 public venues to visit between the two available neighborhoods, and most of them are duplicated. There are three variations on bars, two museums, two parks, two gyms, and a library, and because the world is so small, it felt like I kept running into the same few people no matter where I went. I thought Jess would be able to meet new people through work, but nope! Coworkers don’t really exist, as far as I can tell, even the ones Jess supposedly flirted with at work. In keeping with the tiny neighborhoods, careers are complete rabbit-holes – your Sim just vanishes from the curb in front of their house when it’s time to go to work. After meeting Jess’ future husband, Jamari, and deciding that he was the most eligible bachelor she was going to find (he had the “family-oriented” trait), I ended up keeping her at the house most of the time, which makes everything feel even smaller.\nOn the bright side, thanks to the new-and-improved Sim multitasking, being a bit of a recluse wasn’t so bad. My second Sim creation, Juniper, would walk her bouncy self up to Jess’ door and keep her company as she worked on one programming project or another. Jess could code while chatting with Juniper, then eat while watching TV with Juniper and text Jamari while on the toilet (presumably about Juniper). Conversations, it follows, have a similar ease of flow. Jamari, a line cook, would come home and make food for Jess and Juniper while having a conversation with both of them, easily switching between blowing kisses at the former and telling jokes to the latter. It’s really nice to not have to micromanage Sims’ interactions at every turn, and it’s especially fun to watch where these more intelligent conversations go when you’re not interfering. On more than one occasion, I’ve watched Sims gain the “embarrassed” emotion while chatting because of a misguided romantic advance or a joke that no one really got.\nAre you ready for a break from the feels? Me too! On the absolutely non-emotional side of The Sims 4, Build Mode has been significantly improved over The Sims 3’s version. I was particularly excited about cabinet and counter customization; you can have super-cool half-counters to end a kitchen in a less abrupt way or half-cabinets for over the fridge. Trust me, it’s really cool. Probably more universally exciting are the ability to pick up entire rooms and move them anywhere on the lot without razing them to the ground and rebuilding them, and the push-and-pull tool (similar to body mod in Create-a-Sim) which allows you to move or resize an entire length of wall all at once. Some of the new tools are quirky, however — foundations are now applied retroactively, which is cool if you’re like me and don’t feel like demolishing an entire house just to add a porch, but they apply to every structure on the entire lot. This means no split-levels and no garages, but since there aren’t any cars in The Sims 4, the latter isn’t a huge deal.\ntitle=&type=articles%2Cvideos&tags=The%20Sims%204&count=6&columnCount=6&theme=article\nExcept no cars in The Sims 4 is a huge deal, because this is supposed to be a people simulation, and people very often have cars. People also don’t erupt from the bassinet and immediately enter childhood, but Sims in The Sims 4 do, since there are no toddlers. The Sims 3’s Create-a-Style tool is also history, a bit of a letdown for my interior design sensibilities. Granted, I was successfully able to give Jess and Jamari a matching, cohesive space-age house with the tools available, but I’m still sad that I can’t make cool pajamas in the exact print I want or buy a couch in the style I’d like while also picking a nice color. Pools, though, are perhaps the most conspicuous and ridiculous omission. For a decade-plus they’ve been well-known as the most popular way to murder Sims, if you’re into that. Both build options and furnishing options seem really barren at this point, but knowing The Sims, that will be remedied in one way or another eventually (for a fee, of course).\nVerdict\nTransitioning from The Sims 3 to The Sims 4 is a little rough. The Sims 4 seems barren of content and features by comparison, especially with regard to the severely limited scope of the world and frequent (but much shorter) loading screens and noticeable absence of toddlers, pools, and cars. It’s not so much that Maxis didn’t recreate all the same features, but rather that there aren’t enough cool new things to replace what’s missing. Yet The Sims 4 does succeed in being a deep and complex game when it comes to Sim interactions, with lots of entertaining emotional potential. The emotions system and its contextual actions are really strong and added to my investment in my Sims as well as my enjoyment from watching ridiculousness unfold. Plus, excellent building tools make architecture more fun than ever. Overall, it’s a good start to what may eventually be expanded into a great Sims game, but it’s not there yet.

    "title": "Dark Souls",
    "review": "There are some things that only videogames can do. For me, Dark Souls' predecessor Demon's Souls was emblematic of all of them. Where most games do their best to be something else – to tell a story like a novel, to impress with cinematic techniques like a film – Demon's Souls is pure game, a complete and darkly fascinating vision that makes no concessions to the modern conception of how games should be. Instead, it was an exploration of how games could be; how bleak, how twisted, how focused and – most famously – how challenging. Most developers take pains to protect you from failure. FROM Software turns it into an artform.\nDark Souls is the next step along that path. Like Demon's Souls, it is a brutal and demanding third-person action-RPG set in a world full of monstrous, disturbing things that are trying their hardest to end your life as quickly as possible. Using whatever weapons and armor you can scavenge, buy or forge, the challenge is to inch your way through this damned and deadly place, now and then coming across gigantic bosses that take especial valor and tenacity to kill. The eventual aim is to make it out alive, but there are about 50-60 hours of creative cruelty between you and that goal.\nYou will die, a lot. You will die on the end of a sword, on the edge of an axe, crushed by a boulder, impaled on fangs; you will be poisoned, eaten, stabbed, assassinated and pushed off cliffs. Death is everything in Dark Souls. It's education, it's progress, it's the recurring stylistic and thematic motif that runs through all of its spectacularly varied, decaying and depraved environments. The first thing that you have to understand about this game is that survival is in itself a tremendous accomplishment. It can be punishing, cruel, sadistic and uncompromising. It can also be the purest, most thrilling adrenaline rush in gaming – it can take over your life and reward you like nothing else can. Exactly because your chances of success are so slim, each victory feels monumental.\nThe open-world structure is the biggest change since Demon's Souls. Beginning in a rotting asylum for the undead, you move through a vast, connected world comprised of fetid swamps, grandly dilapidated towns and castles, magma-carved caves and tunnels deep within the earth, trap-filled dungeons and much else. Some are reminiscent of Demon's Souls' environments, like the rickety, swampy, disease-ridden Blighttown, whilst others are entirely new; austere marble palaces, murky forests, ashen lakes.\nThe further you get in Demon's Souls, the more hideous and creative the monsters and environments become. Thirty hours in, stuck in an underground poisonous swamp, you'll feel like you'd give anything to see the sun again. Dark Souls' design is so consistently twisted that it actually starts to encroach on your mental well-being after extended play – it never wavers for a second from its singular stylistic vision.\nThere's no central hub, no safe haven for you to run back to and recuperate. Instead, there are bonfires strategically placed around the world. Bonfires are your checkpoints, the place where you can hunker down to replenish your health flasks, spend the souls of vanquished enemies on leveling up, repair your equipment, and meditate on your doomed existence. Resting at a bonfire ensures that you'll spawn there the next time you're dispatched, but resting also respawns all the enemies in an area (except bosses). Deciding when and where to rest, then, becomes a major part of your strategy. You can go through the same areas again and again, collecting souls and learning enemy attack patterns to make yourself stronger, or you can push onwards towards the next bonfire, risking the unknown.\nimageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fps3media.ign.com%2Fps3%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F119%2F1197278%2Fds01fire_1317398826.jpg&caption=These+will+kill+you+with+fire.\nOnline, you'll frequently see the ghosts of other players huddled around the bonfires, giving you a sense of togetherness and camaraderie in situations that would otherwise feel depressingly hopeless. Dark Souls' world is (for the most part) exquisitely designed around these checkpoints – shortcuts and secret passages open up that let you access more and more of the map from a single resting point, so making your way around a world that at first seems intimidatingly huge quickly becomes second nature.\nWhen you die in Dark Souls, you become Hollowed, and lose any souls that you've collected. Make it back to your bloodstain before dying again, and you can get them back – but you usually run straight into the clawed arms of whatever horrendous thing dispatched you the first time. Souls can be spent on leveling yourself up, buying an extra sliver of health or stamina or magical capability. Humanity, on the other hand, is much more precious resource; you can only get it from items or by beating bosses, whether in your own game or as a helpful Phantom in someone else's. It can be used to kindle bonfires, giving yourself extra health flasks, and to revive yourself to Human, which lets you summon other players to help you in your game.\nThe combat system is the beating black heart at the center of Dark Souls. Given the sheer variety of demons after your blood – serpent-warriors, evil butchers, skinless undead, cat-alligators, skeletal swordsmen and much, much else – your survival depends greatly on how you adapt to changing situations. You can switch between armored tank and nimble thief just by switching around your weapons and armor. To be a mage or a healer, all you need to do is find a sorcerer's catalyst or a talisman. The game never forces you into a certain playstyle. There's no limit to what you can carry, for instance, so you can hold on to any dagger or bow or interesting spell in case it comes in handy hours later.\nThe way that magic works has changed since Demon's Souls, making it much more difficult to rely on it as an easy way out and forcing you to engage with the heart-in-mouth, up-close melee combat. Instead of a magic bar, you get a certain number of casts for each spell each time you rest at a bonfire – powerful Pyromancy or life-saving Miracles will usually be limited to just a few uses. Magic is as relevant to the game as ever, but it's no longer a cheap-and-easy, rechargeable long-range option. Sooner or later, especially in the boss battles, you're going to have to wade on in there with an axe and risk your hide up close.\nThis is one of many reasons that Dark Souls is considerably harder than Demon's Souls. (For context, I played through Demon's Souls about four times, and nothing in that game gave me the same trouble – and the same rush – as some of Dark Souls' crueler moments.) It appears to be FROM's mission to send you into harrowing spirals of despondency and self-pity at every opportunity. Levels and enemies alike are designed to be especially lethal. Like its predecessor, the game starts off borderline impossible and becomes more manageable the longer you play as you get together some half-decent equipment and build up your stats, but Dark Souls discourages grinding.\nThere's a slightly uneven, discouraging distribution of souls throughout most of the game, where extremely strong enemies reward you with only a few hundred souls. It evens out later; as the going gets tougher, the game design seems to acknowledge that you'll need to build up your level through repeating sections that you already know, and litters them with soul-rich enemies to farm. But overall, it's time-consuming and impractical to progress through grinding alone. Instead, Dark Souls' difficulty pushes you towards its forward-thinking online features.\nDark Souls is tightly designed around its community and co-operative aspects, far more so than Demon's. Because the game doesn't bother to explain itself to you at all, you will rely on other players to build up your knowledge, sharing strategies, directions to secret areas and tips on where to find rare weapons and items, piecing together a collective understanding of arcane arts like weapons forging. This community aspect is the most extraordinary thing about Dark Souls – you're all in it together, and the knowledge that there are others sharing your experience is what turns Dark Souls from a depressing solo journey into a breathtaking collective achievement.\nimageUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fps3media.ign.com%2Fps3%2Fimage%2Farticle%2F119%2F1197278%2Fds03cut_1317399443.jpg&caption=These+will+cut+you+in+half%2C+and+push+you+off+the+ledge.\nAs you wander the parapets of the Undead Burg, you'll occasionally hear the tolling of the bell at the top of the gargoyle tower, signifying someone else's triumph over a boss. You'll feel spurred on to success yourself, reassured that it's not impossible, or you'll smile at the memory of your own victory if you're already further on. The shadows of other players move through the world, showing you snatches of someone else's game. Bloodstains splatter across the flagstones where people have died, replaying the final seconds of their life when you touch them. By offering yourself up as a phantom to assist in someone else's game, you can not only earn souls and Humanity, but you can learn new things, gaining experience from others. The absence of voice chat and matchmaking is integral to this sense of collective suffering and achievement. Your rescuer will always be a stranger.\nIt is impossible to overstate how crucial online play is to the Dark Souls experience. Without it, it's half a game (and about four times as difficult, too, which is really not what you want from a game that's already difficult enough to sap your will to live). Multiplayer is your get-out clause, the thing that stops Dark Souls from ever being straightforwardly impossible, no matter what your skill level. There are points in the game where you actually need help; FROM's tacit admission of this comes in the form of NPC summon signs that appear outside certain boss battles, letting you summon help even if you're playing the game offline. Run out of Humanity, though, and this option is closed to you, leaving you with the choice between hours of grinding or hours of fruitless attempts at battles that are incredibly difficult on your own.\nLike everything in the game, though, the multiplayer has its dark side. Players can invade your world if you're in Human form and assassinate you. But this is a much less frequent occurrence than it was in Demon's Souls. In order to invade other players at will, you actually have to join an in-game covenant – otherwise you have to rely on limited-use items. There's also an indictment system where you can report someone who assassinates you, which enters their name into a giant, publicly-accessible Book of the Guilty. The emphasis this time around is very firmly upon helping other players, rather than hurting them.\nThe difficulty is central to Dark Souls' ethos, and shouldn't be considered a fault. Without it, it wouldn't be the game that it is, it wouldn't require the same ingenuity and persistence from you, and its rewards would not be so sweet. There are times, though, when Dark Souls crosses the line from thrillingly challenging to straightforwardly sadistic. There are frog-like sewer-dwelling creatures that can Curse you with their attacks, instantly reducing your health bar to half its former size; the only way to get cured is to visit a healer hidden deep within a dangerous ghost-populated area that's a long, long journey away (or to buy an item from a vendor, if you've got enough souls).\nMaking your way through Dark Souls' death-trap world with half a health bar is hard enough, but the Curse effect stacks – so if you get caught again, you'll be down to a quarter of a health bar. A third time, you'll be down to an eighth. I know one Dark Souls player who lost something like 10 hours trying to make it to a healer when everything in the world could kill him with one hit. There's punishing, and then there's unfair.\nOne of the mid-game bosses, meanwhile, emits corrosive bile that swiftly degrades your equipment if you get stuck in its flow, potentially leaving you standing naked in front of a hideous dragon with a broken sword. There's no way to repair weapons and armor once they've been completely destroyed, so it's possible to lose all your best gear in this battle. Similarly, there are areas in the mid-section of the game where the main challenge isn't overcoming the skinless poisonous demons that live there, but struggling not to get knocked off narrow, precarious ledges by their attacks.\nWithout wanting to spoil the plot, Dark Souls sends you deeper into the earth with every victory, becoming extraordinarily imaginative in its sadism. Dark Souls' story is subtly and sparsely told, leaving you to write your own mythology, giving you only cryptic, unsettling verses of vague exposition to go on. The world speaks for itself.\nBut there are, despite its bleakness, real moments of beauty in Dark Souls – like the moment where you round a corner after one of the game's early bosses and see the sun for the first time, shining down through a break in the clouds, or the moment when you're standing at the top of a belltower looking out at the sprawling land below, trying to decide where to go next whilst you bask in the afterglow of a boss defeat. It's these moments, not the hours spent butting your head up against the same boss without success, that you'll remember about Dark Souls: the improbable, hard-fought victories, the game-changing discoveries, and the moments where a kind stranger lifted you out of a ditch you couldn't escape on your own.\nVerdict\nThe reviewer's job is difficult when it comes to a game like Dark Souls. I simply can't unreservedly recommend that you buy it. It's not a game that you play to relax. It doesn't care in the slightest about whether you're enjoying yourself, and it doesn't give a fig for your notions of entertainment or your mental well-being. If you just play games for fun, this isn't for you, and no amount of insistence on my part is going to change that. But if you're interested in the limits of the videogame form – to see just how focused, how pure and how uncompromising in its vision a game can be – Dark Souls is unmissable. If you take the time get into Dark Souls' mindset, to begin to understand the twisted way in which it operates and taste the rewards behind its cruellest challenges, this is one of the most thrilling, most fascinating and most completely absorbing experiences in gaming.",

    "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass",
    "review": "Over the years the Zelda franchise has evolved quite differently depending on if you're looking at the console side of things, or just the portable world. While the \"main\" series - if you can call it that - has progressed from classic 2D top-down to 3D, continuing to deliver the same enchanting, epic feeling from iteration to iteration, Link's portable ventures have been a bit skewed. It began humbly with Game & Watch, moved then to Link's Awakening - a pure pocket Zelda - only to morph into the Capcom-created Oracle of Ages/Seasons world, evolving yet again into the Four Swords-like design of Minish Cap on GBA, and finally residing here on DS with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass as a fully touch-based, 3D Zelda set in the world of Wind Waker. Is it the Zelda many of us expected? No. But the legend still lives on.\n\nFrom the moment it was revealed it was quite obvious that Nintendo was sending a message to the world with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. First and foremost, the game is a pure testament to both the power and innovative aspects of DS, delivering an overall product that will blow gamers away visually, stylistically, and cinematically. At the same time, Phantom Hourglass also delivers a message direct from Nintendo's \"every-gamer\" stance, as it's lighthearted, more casual in its overall manner, and touch-driven; attributes that are aimed to captivate any and every DS owner out there. The spirit of the Zelda franchise is still there of course, but it's as if Nintendo went back and morphed the core design into something that could appeal to a much wider audience.\n\nIn The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass players again assume the role of a green-clad hero who, for the sake of continuity, we'll refer to as Link. The story is taken directly from the Wind Waker world on GameCube, basically picking up where the last game left off, as Link and Tetra sail off into the sunset. The game opens with the two of them manning Tetra's ship as they search for the infamous Ghost Ship that is said to sail the seven seas. After a pretty engaging opening, Tetra of course fulfills her role as the damsel in distress, and it's up to Link to get her back. It's classic Zelda storytelling, and we wouldn't have it any other way. From there Link meets up with a loud-mouthed fairy named Ciela and a Jack Sparrow-like treasure hunter named Linebeck, and the story kicks off.\n\nRight off the bat you'll notice that Phantom Hourglass brings an impressive amount of cinematic presentation to the table. The graphical style is of course a play off the cel-shaded Zelda, but what really gives the game the \"pocket Cube\" feel to it is that every scene is shot with theatrics in mind, as there's a ton of emotion and depth to the characters. You're also going to notice, however, that the game can be a bit long-winded for the Zelda purists out there, and that constant commentary by Linebeck, Ciela, or numerous other characters in the world will continue well into the back half of the game. This of course improves the relationship between the gamer and the cast, but we can also see hardcore Zelda fans wishing the game would just back off and let them be on their way.\n\n\nAnd when moving into the core of the gameplay this \"casual vs. hardcore\" aspect that Zelda's new attitude will inevitably bring is even more apparent. The controls, as mentioned, are entirely touch-based, so players looking for the classic Zelda feel will need to adapt to using a stylus instead of a d-pad. There's no way around it, no alternate control scheme, and the game doesn't apologize for its drastic change, even poking fun at the hardcore in one of the final dungeons by having a ghost of a fallen warrior mention that his desire for d-pad controls was his \"only regret\" in life. It's pretty obvious Nintendo wanted to change things up a bit this time around, and love it or hate it, Phantom Hourglass is a touch-only game.\n\n\nDoes it work though? For the most part, yes, although there are some definite gripes to be had with the new direction. General movement is fine, having players move Link around by dragging the stylus which in turn positions Ciela. Link automatically runs towards the fairy, so players have direct control in the sense that he will always make a direct line from his current position to your stylus tip. Depending on how far away Ciela is from his body, Link will creep slowly, walk, jog, or sprint. For combat and additional maneuverability you swipe with the stylus to attack - or simply tap on enemies if they're within range - draw a circle around Link to do the spinning sword attack, or push against the edge of the screen to have him roll.\n\nWhere this becomes an issue, however, is that everything is assigned to touch. Attacking, rolling, and running is all left to the DS's interpretation, and while it works for the definite majority of the time it isn't nearly as precise as d-pad controls. Link will sometimes roll seemingly on his own, something that becomes an issue when working near the edge of a cliff, he'll swipe his sword when the player attempts to turn too fast - though as you get used to the controls this is more of a random occurrence - and at times players looking to execute a dodging roll may find that it's not always as receptive as you'd like. We don't want to paint the picture that Zelda is a \"broken game\", as that is most certainly not the case, but it will take some getting used to after 20 years of d-pad control. Team those little issues with the realization that your hand is going to be covering the bottom screen from time to time, or that the stylus width on DS is about the height of Link himself, and you can see where a more traditional gamer - or large-pawed one - would trade his gold Ocarina copy for a \"classic\" control scheme.\n\nThere's a flipside to this all, however, and it's a huge one. As one of Phantom Hourglass's most redeeming qualities - and one that makes it a must-have for DS owners - the innovation that comes with the touch screen is simply amazing, including everything from course-charting to note-taking, to more tactile aspects such as item usage and true weapon precision. Phantom Hourglass allows for a seemingly never-ending list of ways to use the DS in conjunction with items, and it feels great. Drawing the path of Link's boomerang reinvents the whole game alone, as you'll be able to - and need to - toss it down corridors, around barriers, and behind enemies for back-attacks.\n\nAs you find more and more items throughout the game you'll realize just how innovative the DS can be, as Phantom Hourglass truly stretches what can be done on the system. In some cases this can actually hurt Zelda a bit, as our minds instantly ran wild with ideas once we saw some of the item uses, and there just isn't enough space or time to push each item's potential to its fullest. At times the game even introduces one aspect of an item, uses it only once or twice after, and moves on. It's too bad, but it does keep the adventure feeling fresh throughout. Phantom Hourglass could have been a 100 hour game and we'd still be raving about its innovative item usage; they're just that much fun to use.\n\n\nAnd of course when you think of entertaining items you instantly focus on the weapon-specific bosses that Zelda is so famous for. Phantom Hourglass is no different, having each labyrinth focus on one item as a theme, and then bringing it all together for epic one-on-one battles as a finale, and it's one of the best cumulative boss packages we've seen across any Zelda game over the last 20 years, period. Nintendo made a point to not only create innovative and entertaining boss bouts, but to actually change the style of each as the game went on. You'll seldom experience the same type of fight, as some require you to work specifically on the bottom screen while others have you shooting from bottom to top, or instead seeing the battle from dual perspectives that are each essential to defeating the foe. It's truly amazing.\n\nOne fight will have you attacking a two-screen tall enemy, while the next all of a sudden changes the entire concept of a boss battle, requiring your eyes to not only float from screen to screen, but use a combination of viewpoints to solve the enemy's riddle. Our only gripe in the fights was that they were over too quickly, each taking a few seconds to figure out, and then three or four relays of the attack pattern to dispatch. Only near the end of the game did we actually die during boss fights, a few of which lasted a few minutes in length; longer than their predecessors.\n\n\nThat same feeling carries over from item usage and boss battles into the overall labyrinth play this time around. It's fun, we love every second of it, and then it ends abruptly. Dungeons feel shorter and more linear in this Zelda than any before it, all the while having Ciela or ghosts of old adventurers pipe up and rattle off information on something any gamer would instantly know already. Each time you drop to another floor in a dungeon, the majority of that floor is a self-contained puzzle, as well over 90% of the game's labyrinth work doesn't require you to trek across a dungeon entirely to solve major brain-teasing puzzles, instead moving you one room at a time.\n\nIf you walk over to a group of four levers, make a note of it and continue on; you'll soon find a tablet or ghost that has only one message for you: 4,2,1,3. If you break open a suspiciously located pot only to find five arrows, pull out your bow, as there's a target somewhere to hit, and the game is just making sure you have what you need to complete the task without backtracking. This formula continues as the game goes on, though it does get a bit harder once you reach the back half of the adventure. If you're expecting anything akin to A Link to the Past, Link's Awakening, or even Minish Cap, however, you'll find you're over-thinking it.\n\nThose moments are in there, they just occur at a much smaller rate. The time-based challenges in the Temple of the Ocean King, for example, can be tough as nails, requiring you to not only beat it in a certain amount of time, but also navigate the dungeons around invincible guardians called Phantoms. This final labyrinth is actually an aspect of the game that runs parallel to the rest of the story, so every time you defeat a boss or complete a leg of your journey you'll be called to again traverse a section of the time-based challenge. As our only gripe with this design, there are over ten levels to complete, and only one halfway point throughout the game, which means you'll be replaying sections of the temple every few hours. Each time you enter you'll have new items to use that speed up the previous levels and gain you more time to dive deeper though, so while it can feel like artificially extended gameplay at times, it still serves a purpose. It can become redundant opening the same chests, moving the same force gems, and unlocking the same doors over and over again, however.\n\nBut for every gripe we have about Phantom Hourglass, there seems to be numerous praises as well. For starters, the game is truly epic in scope, opening up the world more than we ever anticipated on DS. Sailing is of course back, but without the reliance on wind you can now draw your path and cruise from point A to point B. All the while it feels as though the world is alive, as other boats inhabit the same waters, pirates patrol and attack, enemies pop up and try to sink your ship, merchants cruise the waters acting as mobile item-shops, and a rival pirate lass tracks your ship down for impromptu duels. The main quest comes in shorter than our liking, sitting at 15 hours over four sittings for our play-through, but the amount of side quests raises that amount substantially, as there are tons of uncharted islands, treasure maps that lead to ocean-floor loot, and the occasional mini-games such as archery or cannon-firing that let you cash in rupees for a chance at prizes. To tie it all together there's also a treasure aspect to the game, which allows you to discover and sell off valuables, or unlock 81 different ship pieces to essentially build your own vessel and power it up with like-themed items. There's an immense amount of adventure to be had here.\n\nAnd as for the overall package you're getting with Phantom Hourglass, it's easy to put aside the gripes of touch-only control or a shorter, easier quest when you take a second to truly appreciate the total package. The visuals are stunning, the music is extremely epic, making great use of DS's sound card to deliver some decent area-specific sound for players using headphones, and a musical score that - while not dethroning the best of the Zelda series - is captivating and memorable. Also included is the multiplayer mode, which delivers a one-on-one battle in single card, multi-card, or Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection mode.\n\n\nUsers can connect with other Phantom Hourglass owners and battle in a Link vs. Phantoms mini-game that works like a game of triforce-stealing capture the flag, and while it's a fun diversion from the main game it doesn't have the standing power or pure addictive nature as Four Swords did. The online portion has a decent amount of depth though, as players keep an overall standing including their wins, losses, and disconnections, and you can battle friends, or go nation/worldwide in two different random battle modes as well. Single card download play offers the same game, but battle stats aren't saved when finished. If battle isn't your thing, you can always stock away treasure or ship parts to trade as well, which is a decent - but somewhat needless - addition.\nVerdict\nWhen looking at specific aspects of Nintendo's latest Zelda offering it's easy to write this one off as too different, too kiddy, or too easy. Nintendo went for a more casual approach this time around, keeping the amount of hardcore dungeon-crawling to a minimum, and shedding the traditional control scheme for a more casual-friendly approach. But with that being said, Phantom Hourglass is still an extremely ambitious, entertaining, and innovative product. Hardcore Zelda fans will find this to be an easier experience than previous handheld efforts, but when looking at the total package it's easy to see that amidst the \"classic vs. touch\" arguments and \"hardcore vs. casual\" debates that will undoubtedly arise, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass is truly an amazing product worthy of praise. The music is impressive, visual style unrivaled on DS at this point, item design truly innovative, and boss work nothing short of genius. The game will run hardcore gamers just over 15 hours, with side quests adding an additional five or so on top of it, but more than the sheer length of the game is the fact that Nintendo managed to take the entire world inspired by Wind Waker, shrink it down, and deliver the same living-world experience in a pocket adventure, and it's simply fun to sail, interact in the world, and seek out all the little things that round off the experience.\nIt comes down to this: Great games are made up of a series of truly captivating moments. A Link to the Past had the unveiling of the master sword, Ocarina of Time hooked gamers with the simplicity and entertainment of riding the Hyrule countryside with Epona for the very first time, and Twilight Princess astonished loyal Zelda fans as they witnessed their hero change forms in the midst of the twilight. The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass has those moments too, and while it may be more casual than we'd like, it's captivating, entertaining, and a true adventure worthy of the Zelda name. It's different, but it's still the real deal.",

    "title": "God of War III",
    "review": "After three years of development and three very long years of waiting, the end is finally upon us. God of War III marks the finale to Kratos' search for revenge and properly caps off a trilogy that ranks near the very top of the best action games ever list. Yes indeed, everything does come to a complete and decisive close by the end, and though it may not be the last that we've seen of the franchise, this really is the end of this tale.\n\nWell, probably.\n\nTaking the old \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" rule at face value, Sony Santa Monica has done very little to alter how things work, though there's been a bit of welcome polish on nearly every facet of gameplay. That is, if you were expecting a revolution in terms of design, you'll be sorely disappointed. But, if you simply wanted more of what has made the series so great up to this point, you're going to be quite happy indeed.\n\nCLICK THE IMAGE TO WATCH OUR IN-DEPTH VIDEO REVIEW.\nWhat has worked in the past largely still holds true here in great fashion. God of War III practically redefines what the word \"scale\" means with regards to videogames, as it throws you into scenes with Titans that are larger than entire levels in some other games. The scope of some of these sequences is nothing short of astounding, with playable sequences that take place on creatures the size of a skyscraper. Sony Santa Monica has been promising this all along, but even when you know what sort of experience you're in for, you'll still be blown away by the immensity of some scenes.\n\nWhile size is a hugely impressive aspect of the game, more than anything else, God of War III is a tour-de-force in terms of its visuals, and it's even more brutal than any of its predecessors. Yes, this is a very M-rated game, one filled with blood, gore and detached limbs, but what's important is that it all makes sense. Greek mythology was filled with violence, and Kratos' latest doesn't hold back in all the right ways.\n\nThe combat is just as responsive as ever with big, massive combos that you'll always feel completely in control of. You can cancel out of almost anything and go into a block or roll, making defensive maneuvers a strong (and very necessary) part of your arsenal. One subtle tweak this time around is that the old Square-Square-Triangle combo that ends with Kratos whipping down the Blades in a big overhand motion isn't as easily abused as it once was. This is partly due to the fact that you'll find yourself surrounded by more enemies than ever before, requiring that you utilize your area attacks more often, but it's also because enemies can be more aggressive. If you're in their sights, they're probably attacking, which makes the combat a little more balanced between blocking, rolling and attacking; that's great. It's not a huge change, but it's certainly very welcome.\n\nKRATOS LOOKS INCREDIBLE (AND DEADLY).\nOne problem with past God of War titles was that despite the fact that you'd pick up a handful of other weapons along the way, in large part they weren't very useful as your blades seemed to almost always be more effective. That's been fixed this time, and all three of the other weapons you acquire are good in almost any situation. That's even more true thanks to the fact that you can now switch between them on the fly, mid-combo, allowing you to string together big sequences will all four weapons in use.\n\nMy only complaint here is that two of the three additional weapons that you'll earn are extremely similar to your blades. They have unique powers and slightly different moves, but by and large, they're more of the same. The Cestus (the pair of big metal gloves that you've no doubt seen previously) is really the only weapon that's truly unique, and fortunately those are both useful and great fun to take into battle, but it's hard to not wish that your other pickups were as different at the Cestus.\n\n\nAnother cool change to the mechanics is that your magic is now tied to each weapon, so switching between these has become not only simpler, but it's also easier to tell what magic you have selected. All of this is still relegated to directions on the D-Pad, though you can now quick-swap between weapons (and therefore magic) mid-combo by pressing L1 and X. This setup actually makes a lot of sense in the context of the game as well because most of the magic comes directly from the weapons rather than being some ethereal power that Kratos magically (pun intended) gains at some point.\n\nOne change that we first saw in the E3 2009 demo, which resulted in a bit of controversy, is that the quick-time event button prompts that come up during kill moves are now situated at the edges of the screen, allowing you to watch what's happening and use your peripheral vision to see which button to press rather than have the prompts appear over top of the action. I'm a big fan of this change as it allows you to pay attention to the action rather than waiting to see what button appears next.\n\nCLICK THE IMAGE TO WATCH THE LATEST TRAILER.\nAnother thing that I'm a big fan of this time around is that Sony Santa Monica uses the camera in a much more cinematic way throughout the game. No, you still don't have control over it as the camera is specifically placed in spots for each scene (it's still controlled for you, in other words), but there's a lot more play with it during cutscenes, including in-game kills. While you'll still see the slow pans here and there to show you where you should go next or what door you've just opened with a switch, other sequences where you don't have direct control over Kratos feature multiple camera cuts from some nice angles. It's great to see the team play with how the camera is used as I think there were some missed opportunities in the past.\n\nOne other seriously impressive bit about presentation changes is that there are no CG cutscenes in the game. Outside of the cool credits intro, everything else was rendered in the game engine with zero post-production effects added. Some scenes were too intense for the engine to handle without chugging a bit so those scenes are presented as a movie (individual frames were spit out and put together as a film), but everything you see matches up almost seamlessly because of this. In fact, if you aren't really looking for it you might not ever notice the cuts, which is great.\n\nTHE COMBAT HAS BEEN REFINED TO NEAR-PERFECTION.\nAs I mentioned previously, the game can look incredible. There are scenes that look like they were ripped straight out of WETA Digital's render farm with lighting so immaculate that your eyes will drop out of their sockets. Truly, God of War III presents some of the most impressive visuals that I've ever seen in a game. Kratos in particular looks phenomenal, and is perhaps the single most impressive-looking character ever in videogames.\n\nHowever, the graphical fidelity is not entirely consistent. There are a couple areas of the game that just don't match up to the most impressive stuff, creating an uneven feeling in the visual presentation. Granted, even at its worst God of War III still looks really good, but some spots just don't feature the same level of lighting quality or perhaps texture work as others. The biggest culprits in this issue, however, are some of the characters. There are a few that look fantastic, but many are clearly not on the same level as Kratos, and some are even only passable as \"good\".\n\n\nThis issue of inconsistency also unfortunately applies to the story. Despite how relatively simplistic the previous story entries were, they were told extremely well. Everything made sense and there was a clear purpose of what was happening and why. Here, the story (and therefore the game's progression) seems to buckle under its own weight at times. It's a little more complex, attempting to introduce intangible concepts that I won't spoil here, but it doesn't work as well for me as the more straightforward tales from past titles.\n\nThis also means that some of the progression elements aren't connected quite as well as I'd have hoped. There are a couple areas that feel a little out of place, largely because they're there to serve a story that isn't as finely tuned as it could have been. It's tricky to really explain this more without spoiling anything, but some spots just don't feel as old and timeless as big locations have in the past (like the Island of Fate or Pandora's Temple), which makes things seem a little less \"epic\" in terms of historical importance and breadth of scale.\n\nCLICK THE IMAGE TO WATCH OUR GOD OF WAR IN FIVE MINUTES VIDEO FEATURE.\nBack to the good stuff though... this of course wouldn't be a God of War game without some intense boss battles, and God of War III largely delivers in that respect. What's really cool is that there are a handful of fights that aren't executed in standard form, where you would just need to kill them before they kill you. Sony Santa Monica played with how some of these encounters could work quite a bit, and in these cases, the sequences fit the story better than if these characters just stepped up and fought with incredible combat skills.\n\nGod of War 3 Guide» God of War 3 Walkthrough & Bosses» God of War 3 Godly Possessions» God of War 3 Gorgon Eye LocationsNot every section of every battle is incredible, but there are some really good fights in store for you. The second half of one in particular (probably about half-way through) devolves into an extremely brutal melee brawl that now ranks amongst my favorite one-on-one battles ever.\n\nAs has been the case with both PlayStation 2 releases, there are a ton of extras included on the disc including behind-the-scenes footage, a series of very difficult challenges and an arena battle room. Note that if the arena battles sound interesting, you have to finish the game and then the Challenge of Olympus (same deal as the Challenge of the Gods from past titles) before you can try that mode out.\n\nTHE SCALE IN GOD OF WAR III IS UNMATCHED.\nAs far as the videos go, The Making of God of War III is your usual behind-the-scenes, all-encompassing clip that I found to be very enjoyable. In addition to this, there are some 15-plus other videos that dive into specific aspects, including level design, the music and visual effects. It's all really good stuff and will take you a couple hours to go through if you watch all of it. And yes, it's all in HD.\nVerdict\nGod of War III is a great end to Kratos' console trilogy. It's not perfect, with some uneven storytelling and progression here and there, but it's still a fantastic overall package. The combat is stellar once again, it's bloodier than ever, and it is at times the best looking game ever released. I still think God of War II is the best in the trilogy, but Sony Santa Monica did a great job closing up Kratos' journey for revenge.",

    "title": "Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception",
    "review": "Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is the reason I play video games. From the smile plastered on my face during the opening montage to the disbelief that swept over me as Chapter 2 began to the middle of the night text message I shot a friend about a relationship reveal, I couldn't stop loving this touching, beautiful, fun and engaging game. From the moment the music swells on the title screen to the moment the credits roll, Uncharted 3 is a masterpiece.\nThat shouldn't surprise you. The original Drake's Fortune set the bar for visuals and third-person adventures on the PlayStation 3. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves greatly improved on that, added multiplayer and climbed its way to the 2009 IGN Game of the Year award. Developer Naughty Dog spent the two years since then making bigger moments -- think platforming in a capsized cruise ship and surviving a cargo plane crash -- and working on the few complaints from the last title. Complaints primarily stemming from the fact that, to some, Uncharted 2 felt too much like the original Uncharted.\nUncharted 3's tale sounds familiar. We have the same cast of characters in our handsome hero Nathan Drake and his seasoned mentor Victor \"Sully\" Sullivan and the same general idea of a lost city that needs finding before the bad guys get there. But this isn't the games that came before. Uncharted 3's greatest strength is its unpredictability.\n\nFrom the barroom brawl that opens the game and introduces its new melee system to a mid-game conversation between villainess Katherine Marlowe and Drake that literally redefines a pillar of this franchise, I didn't know what to expect in Uncharted 3. Naughty Dog sets aside the betrayal/twist formula used in the first two games and focuses on Nate and Sully's relationship. It takes you to the precipice of the Uncharted hallmarks you might expect, lets you stare at them, and then veers off in another direction.\nFor the first time, the words \"fun\" and \"useful\" describe melee combat.\n“\nYes, the gameplay still revolves around climbing walls and shooting bad guys, but refinement is found those mechanics. For the first time, the words \"fun\" and \"useful\" describe melee combat. Uncharted 2's clumsy stealth parts no longer exist. Running through levels and taking cover doesn't get old because Naughty Dog has done so much to merge the gameplay with the story, perfecting the pacing and making everything look fantastic in the process thanks to cutting edge graphics and excellent cinematography. The end product rises above what the buttons do and how you maneuver Drake. Calling it a game sells Uncharted 3 short. This is an experience, a complete package.\nVIEW 121 IMAGES\nWhen I rant about why Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception is better than just about anything on the market -- about why I think it's my new favorite game of all time -- I don't talk about the firefights, the new ability to throw grenades back at enemies or collecting the game's 101 well-hidden treasures. I talk about the heart-wrenching section where Drake is by himself and completely lost. He's on his last legs, he's desperate, and I'm right there with him. I'm pushing him through the journey at hand and it's clear that it's a game, but as he stumbles, seeks shelter and loses hope, my heart breaks.\nThis is what Naughty Dog has been building to for the last four years.\n“\nIn a way, this is what Naughty Dog has been building to for the last four years. Players know the Uncharted cast. Most love the banter between Drake and Sully, the love affair between Elena and Drake or the one-liners Drake shouts to himself as the game goes on. Naughty Dog created a universe here that players feel connected with, but, again, the developers toy with that. They insert things that take the mentor/pupil relationship to another level. They flesh out backstories, they break bonds, and they make us face the characters' worst fears. And, no, those fears aren't clowns.\n\nA story-driven affair, Uncharted 3's believability and connection with the player comes from its performances. For the third game in a row, the cast dazzles. The actors record their lines along with their movements, and this leads to characters that feel real. The chemistry between them lights up the game in a way most mediums would kill for -- from tiny touches like fist bumps to major moments of bickering between lovers. Add in a musical score that accentuates the action and layer on the game's trademark, \"best in the industry\" graphics -- sand clinging to Drake's hair, fire creeping up walls, sunlight filtering through tattered roofs -- and you can see where this game becomes more than pressing the X button and jamming on analog sticks.\nWhen the tale finishes, you can look forward to multiplayer. Uncharted 2 introduced competitive and cooperative modes for the series, and Uncharted 3 improves them to make something special. The standard menu returns (team deathmatch, capture the flag, etc.), but Naughty Dog adds bonuses known as Boosters and Kickbacks to round out the experience. These are upgradable bonuses that you equip to make the multiplayer experience more your own.\n\nBoosters augment your entire session -- one reduces respawn time, one lets you climb faster -- whereas the in-match medals you earn count toward unlocking your Kickback, which can instantly spawn an RPG or double your cash earned for a short period of time. These spice up the gameplay; you can pepper them into one of your four saved loadouts and have a skill set for any situation. This stuff will keep me coming back. Even when I have a terrible match in Uncharted 3 multiplayer, I see the cash I've earned counting toward my next level and I see my Boosters earning experience and becoming more powerful.\n\nToss all this into the pot, and matches in Uncharted 3 multiplayer feel fresh every time. The verticality mixed with gunplay leads to different attack plans. There's a sweet science to deploying a Kickback at the perfect time for a critical kill. New Power Plays give teams getting blown out a leg-up like double damage so that everyone feels like they have a shot at competing. Plus, three team deathmatch (2v2v2) is awesome, and you can play split-screen with two different PSN profiles, a rarity on the PlayStation 3.\n\nFor many of you, these multiplayer facts aren't news, as fans have been playing the final version of multiplayer as part of a North American Subway promotion for weeks. However, there was an outcry when the beta went live because Naughty Dog adjusted the damage dealt by bullets and players were now able to absorb more. Many threw their hands up in disgust, and Naughty Dog listened. The developers went in and dialed the damage back to what it was in the summer beta.\nDon't mistake this anecdote as a mistake; it points out the commitment Naughty Dog puts into this multiplayer community. The developers make a game and they want people to enjoy it, they listen to feedback, and they act. There's not much more you can ask from a game creator, and it's one of the reasons I want to keep playing and keep leveling. Add in the fact that Naughty Dog supported Uncharted 2 multiplayer until now and already has seven DLC packs planned for Uncharted 3 multiplayer, and it's clear this game has legs.\nVerdict\nIGN defines a 10.0 -- a masterpiece -- as \"the pinnacle of gaming, a masterpiece may not be flawless, but it is so exceptional that it is hard to imagine a game being better.\" That's Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. From start to finish, single player to multiplayer, this game sings. The characters, the graphics, the sound, the story – they’re all top notch. If you’re willing to skip Uncharted 3, be prepared to miss one of gaming’s finest moments.",

    "title": "The Elder Scrolls Online",
    "review": "Regardless of whether you assume the guise of an orc or an elf, Elder Scrolls Online is the story of an adventurer in search of his or her soul. It's a fitting setup for a beloved single-player franchise that finds itself taking its first shaky steps in the unfamiliar massively multiplayer roleplaying game genre, and just moments past the character creation screen you can feel it struggling to reconcile its heritage with its new duds. Just as the adventurer tries to learn the truth of their past, ESO itself struggles with its identity through each leg of the lengthy leveling content.\nIt's important to view ZeniMax Online's creation as an MMORPG first and an Elder Scrolls game second. Expecting to kill random NPCs or find the free-roaming exploration of a game like Skyrim amid its traditional zone-based progression? It'll always let you down. The good news is that, despite some substantial launch bugs and underwhelming graphics, it exceeds many expectations and captures the Elder Scrolls experience about as well as an MMORPG realistically can.\n\nA Guided Epic\nIt takes a while for the pieces to fall into place over the course of its 100-hour main story, but in time it delivers an experience that's at least as worthy of the Elder Scrolls name as any of the three most recent single-player games. (It suffers from the same occasional cliches, too.) It presents its own unique twists and cameos of important figures from Elder Scrolls lore, as well as a final boss encounter that both exceeds the challenges of some of the single-player games and points to what's in store in the promising Veteran content that comes after 50.\nAs in Skyrim, it's the quests you find from random townsfolk and Dunmer guar herders that make up the bulk of the PvE experience, as well as stories from series favorites such as the Mages’ and Fighters’ Guilds. They're fully voiced to a degree that puts even Star Wars: The Old Republic to shame, although the quality of the delivery from the limited voice actors ranges from adequate to robotic (particularly for some male Argonians). The catch? If you’re unaccustomed to the conventions of MMOs, you may bristle at the sight of other adventurers undertaking the same clandestine dealings with the same sketchy Breton landowners. These stories written for a singular hero but delivered to a crowd are a spot where ESO seems to hold onto its single-player beginnings more than it probably should.\nGood thing, then, that the quests themselves capture the essence of Elder Scrolls. The series' signature quests, which tend to send you into caves and ruins to seek out important relics or slaughter some bandits, match up with traditional instanced MMO design well. You do a lot of killing and fetching, yes, but it's rarely more intrusive than venturing into Skyrim's Korvanjund to cut through dozens of draugr to pick up a toothy crown. Puzzles and investigative missions add further spice, as do quests that affect how NPCs relate to you later down the road depending on your decisions. Further complementing the experience is a soundtrack that generally captures the spirit of Jeremy Soule's celebrated work for the franchise, although it's a shame that the score for the login screen represents Soule's only direct contribution to the project. In spirit, at least, ESO swims in the same low-fantasy vibe that makes Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, and the rest so appealing: you're generally asked to dispatch mundane threats like bandits rather than spending too much time caught up in matters of world import, so when those come along they’re more interesting.\nIf only it looked better. It's clear that ZeniMax Online tried to walk a fine line between Bethesda Softworks’ realistic graphics style and the low-spec-friendly art of World of Warcraft, but the effort resulted in an unsatisfying hybrid look that seldom inspires the taking of screenshots for their own sake (as I tend to do in better looking MMOs). It's strongest in the dungeons, where Ayleid ruins exude more gloom than their cousins in Oblivion, and the doors on Nordic barrows glisten with more detail than their Skyrim cognates. But out in the world, buildings assume a gangly appearance that is better suited to stop-motion Tim Burton films, and common objects like trees often look as though they were lifted from 2002’s Morrowind. If the direction excels, it's only because its earthtone palettes represent a more realistic experience than its festively colored MMO competitors, making it feel a little more grounded.\n\nClimb Every Mountain\nZeniMax Online partly makes up for such shortcomings with a world that encourages rummaging through every crate and nightstand and exploring every mountain path. It's worth doing so not only for the discovery of Skyshards that grant skill points or new quests hiding in remote hills, but also just for the pleasure of stumbling across the sight of NPC mages flinging spells and epithets at each other or random travelers engaged in deep commentary on the legality of skooma. Books and scraps of paper conveying lore and skill points lie in wait everywhere, and a Kindle-like interface goes a long way toward making up for the unfortunate inability to hoard them and stash them on the shelves of a personal home. In a smart move, ZeniMax even kept most quests ungated by level, which means that you can tackle quests 20 levels above you if you have the skills (or the help) to pull it off. It's rough, but it does help recall the unfettered exploration of the single-player games.\nSecuring help in such instances is key to getting the most out of ESO, and working with other players generally improves the experience. Combat gets difficult, for instance, particularly in the veteran levels past 50, and thus assistance from a random player often comes as a godsend when you're swarmed by three enemies or attacking the many world bosses that grant boatloads of experience. As a bonus, I've found many helpful and generous members of the community, particularly once you venture out of the early zones with their (typical) rampant spam from gold sellers. As for the rest? The majority of them outside of guild and party chat seem strangely quiet and aloof for an MMO, which I've attributed to an uncommon number of genre newcomers owing to the series' single-player heritage.\n\nUnfortunately for those of us accustomed to the genre, ESO's multiplayer components don't always work as well as they should. Heavy phasing means you often can't help out a player who's on a quest you completed long ago, and particularly in these crowded days so soon after launch, the open-instanced public dungeons get so packed in early levels that they lose all semblance of challenge. At times, the open-world multiplayer content just feels lazy. ZeniMax attempts to recall the variety of dynamic events in games like Guild Wars 2 and Final Fantasy XIV through its Dark Anchors, but they quickly lose their appeal as they look the same regardless of whether you're in Skyrim or Glenumbra.\nBut ZeniMax succeeds brilliantly in presenting group content elsewhere, particularly in the Veteran dungeons you encounter after the level cap. They demand a level of coordination and strategy among four players that contemporary MMOs tend to shy from, and the encounters require that players assume rules that tend to rigidly fall under the responsibilities of tanks and healers elsewhere. For the hardcore, these present some of ESO's best reasons for buying into the monthly subscription plan. (ZeniMax has made promises of massive new contents updates every four to six weeks, but we’ve heard that before. The proof will be in the pudding.)\n\nGroup activities also abound in the PvP combat in the massive Imperial province of Cyrodiil, which actually takes up much more geographic space than it does in Oblivion. Cyrodiil PvP presents exciting, if familiar, siege-oriented warfare in the style of Dark Age of Camelot and Guild Wars 2, although it also doubles as a sandboxy PvE zone complete with its own quests, Dark Anchors, and public dungeons.\n\nAim For The Knee\n\nOver the course of 170 hours of gameplay, I've come to love The Elder Scrolls Online’s combat more than that in any of the dozens of other MMOs I've played. Much as in Skyrim, it features active blocking and bashing with the right mouse button, and calculated sword swipes with the left. (Ranged combat feels less satisfying, particularly in the case of bows.) It brings a need for timed actions and careful blocks that's often missing in MMOs. When you bring down your sword on an enemy he crumples to a heap, conveying the sense that you've actually done something aside from pressing a hotkey. When you miss, it's because you actually missed. Smaller elements, such as the need to recharge weapons with soul gems and deliver powerful attacks while hidden, pay homage to the single-player games and, in the same way, make you conserve your resources. Even the spartan UI that puts little between you and the world you’re playing in recalls the ambiance of Skyrim (although heavy modding support means you're free to clutter up the screen as you wish).\nESO wisely complements this setup with a 12 hotkeyed abilities scattered across action bars for two swappable weapons, for both variety and action's sake, and a dizzying number of skill points that allow you to create a character pretty much exactly as you wish. As of my last respec at Veteran Rank 1, I had around 140. The only limits are the skills specific to each of the four base classes, but even then each class can hold its own in each of the traditional MMO roles of tanking, healing, and damage dealing, so there’s ample flexibility. Elder Scrolls lore comes further into play with the option to become werewolves or vampires, each complete with their own weaknesses and strengths.\n\nHoning The Craft\n\nYet it's in crafting that Elder Scrolls Online most effectively uses its heritage to distinguish itself from other MMORPGs in a positive way. Alchemy, for instance, requires the same level of experimentation as is found in Skyrim, whether it's in the act of nibbling on herbs to learn their properties or throwing together up to three different ingredients to create powerful potions. \"Heavy\" professions like Blacksmithing and Clothing push it even further, to the point where making new gear involves hours of research or taking gambles on improving gear with rare materials.\nIt's not without its problems. The biggest annoyance is that crafting materials can easily command the bulk of your inventory and bank space if you choose even two skills, and there's no way to sell your items aside from guild stores or hocking them in zone chat. Trading guilds consisting of around 500 members alleviate some of the stress, but the limited audiences mean that you're never sure which of the five guilds you can join would be the best host for your items. To make matters worse, the UI lacks some key, convenient features. A simple search bar, for instance, would make guild stores infinitely more navigable, but as it stands you have to sift through each individual page in a category. This extends to other aspects as well, such as the absence of a simple, unintrusive method of reporting gold spammers.\n\nBut Shor's bones, the bugs at this point remain legion. The popular joke among the community is that nothing makes an Elder Scrolls game more authentic than a slew of bugs—some of Skyrim’s are genuinely entertaining—but the truth is that the worst of them hold us back from enjoying the available content. Early on, a significant quest line bugged for several days in the Ebonheart Pact starting zone of Stonefalls, and it prevented me from accessing so many followup quests that I ventured into the following zone of Deshaan underleveled. The nastiest one I encountered affected the key NPC in the final zone of Coldharbour, restricting access to the bulk of Veteran content for almost a week.\nVeteran content presents its own unique problems. Aside from dungeons and PvP, it essentially consists of spending another 200 hours questing through the Veteran-level zones for the two factions other than your own, shattering the sense of shared experiences and \"homelands\" that's usually so essential in faction-based MMORPGs. At the same time, however, Veteran zones deliver a staggering amount of content. On top of everything else, it adds up to a much greater quantity of content than you typically see in a just-launched MMO.\nVerdict\nTo be explicitly clear, if you don’t enjoy MMORPGs, you probably won’t enjoy The Elder Scrolls Online. Its strong character progression and combat systems better suit the offline Elder Scrolls games than in most MMOs, but it’s very much a game about adventuring with other players. As a fan of both MMORPGs and the Elder Scrolls series, I found it to be one of the most rewarding games in the genre in years. Even while it’s troubled by some extremely annoying bugs and will probably never look great, I’ve loved my time questing through Tamriel, and I look forward to logging back in soon.

    "title": "Final Fantasy XIV",
    "review": "Signing up for an MMO encompasses more than your standard purchase. You're buying into a social network to meet other players and maybe make a few new friends. To some it's an escape, an alternative lifestyle, a toy, an ego machine, and to all it's a game. Simply providing a vast online fantasy world to run around in with others isn't enough these days. While Final Fantasy XIV features a flexible class system and interesting crafting mechanics, issues with its presentation, performance, and core questing structure turn what could be an entertaining online adventure into an arduous experience that, in its current state, isn't worth playing.\n\nIf you're familiar with Final Fantasy XI, Square Enix's previous MMO in its flagship RPG line, you'll know the game was never very easy to get into. While Final Fantasy XIV is certainly more solo-friendly for players who prefer to quest and level on their own, it's disappointingly unfriendly toward those trying figure out all the various rules and systems churning beneath the surface that govern life, advancement, and success in its setting of Eorzea. If you've never played an MMO before, this is most definitely not the place to start. Even genre veterans are going to need to spend a good deal of time scanning fan sites and databases to understand how everything works, even for basic information on necessary functions like performing item repairs.\n\n\nThings do start out in a directed fashion, though. At the beginning you're given a chance to create and name your character. A number of races, from the hulking Roegadyn to the cat-like Miqo'te, can be chosen and customized in a few different ways. As tends to be standard in the genre you'll also be asked to pick a class, though the choice isn't especially meaningful. In Final Fantasy XIV you're never locked into one particular class, so the one chosen at the start only defines your character for as long as it takes to get to an item shop.\n\nBefore stepping onto the game's various progression treadmills you'll be dumped into a sequence of cut-scenes filled with character dialogue, combat, and exploration around whichever city you chose to start in. These story-driven scenes are some of the best parts of the game as it stands right now, helping to tell the tale of the world, showing you around the land, and foreshadowing events to come. More story missions become available at later progression milestones and eventually unlock other extras, but are so spaced out that feel more like bandages to remedy a general lack of narrative context throughout. It's rare to ever feel as though you're questing for a reason outside of bumping up your class rank.\n\nFor braving the dangers that lie outside of the walls of each major starting city in Eorzea you'll have a number of combat options. Magic users will want to take up arms as a Conjurer or Thaumaturge, while those who prefer to hit enemies with heavy things will want to pick the axe-wielding Marauder or the Gladiator who attacks and defends with a sword and shield. The variety of combat classes means players should be able to find a mold in which they feel comfortable, but the nice part is you'll never feel too limited.\n\nBy simply purchasing and equipping a class' weapon type, you become that class. If you're tired of slogging through fight after fight as a Lancer, for instance, you can just equip a bow and all of a sudden you're an Archer. The trick to effective play is unlocking skills in various classes to customize your ideal build. For example, you could level up a Pugilist and a Conjurer to unlock heal abilities, then switch to a Marauder and equip the helpful skills to make you more durable in solo combat. That Square Enix grants this kind of freedom to players is great to see, and it's fun to experiment with all the different styles of play to see what you like best, or simply having the option to quickly swap classes should the needs of a group require a new tank, healer, or ranged damage dealer.\n\nTHE OVERALL GAME WORLD IS ENORMOUS.\n\nThe crafting and gathering systems built into the game also contribute to the class system. If you equip a mining pick, you can then hack at deposits for ore and other valuables. Then if you equip other specialty equipment you'll don the hat of a wide range of production classes, from those that build heavy armor to those that tinker with rings and jewelry. These crafting and gathering systems aren't merely side activities, but heavily integrated into the rhythms of life in Eorzea. Success in crafting and harvesting quests yields points that not only rank up the class, but also contribute to a universal pool of experience called physical level. So while each class is leveled on an individual basis only while the corresponding tool or weapon is equipped, you'll always be earning experience for the physical level. When increased, it frees up points to be assigned to things like attack, defense and accuracy, as well as a variety of magical properties, which gives a solid sense of a growing overall power even while you're not swinging weapons out on the battlefield.\n\nAside from that, crafting is especially important in the game since it's the primary method of getting better gear. The occasional item can be earned by completing quests, but in general if you want better gear you're going to have to build it, buy it directly from a crafter, or find it on the open market. Like many of the game's functions, little is explained about the actual crafting process. Once learned you'll find it's a high risk system that infuses a significant degree of chance into the creation process as you juggle a variety of percentage sliders and an abstract color-coding system. Failure is a frequent part of this process, but that makes successful production all the more satisfying.\n\nBecause of the way the class system is set up you could, theoretically, be a master of all crafts, though realistically I would assume people only have time to focus on one or two things. There's plenty of social interaction built into the creation system, as some classes can only build components that others fashion into a whole, and getting different items repaired requires assistance by specific crafters. The problem since launch has been one of dissemination. It's always possible to spam chat channels with requests for armor or advertisements for personal stock to trade with others, but the heart of Final Fantasy XIV's economy is the market system, which right now is a mess.\n\n\nSquare Enix has said that updates are on the way for improving the markets, but even with some aid it's only one of many examples of a system that wasn't adequately developed prior to launch. As of this review's publish time the system requires you to hire a retainer, an NPC that can be given items and set in an instanced market area. The idea is that other players will enter into this area, find your retainer, and then purchase items you put up for sale. Yet in practice it means there's a disorganized mess of NPC retainers standing around market areas with little indication of what's being sold. If you want to buy a new sword, you have to visit one by one every retainer in sight until you just happen to by chance come across one in stock. It's a grossly inefficient process, and perplexing that it ever made it into the launch version of the game. For a game with such a heavy emphasis on crafted items, it's unfortunate Square Enix felt it was acceptable to implement such a fragmented distribution framework.\n\nOnce you're through with crafting, selling and buying, it's out into the field to you to go participate in the game's quests. These are referred to as levequests of which only a limited quantity are available at a time. In the downtime until more quests unlock, the idea is to get you to interact with others to latch onto their quests, again serving as a method of strengthening the social fabric of the game. Initiating a quest requires you travel out to camps scattered around the landscapes outside of cities. In each sits a giant crystal called an Aetheryte where quests are initiated, and you're then put on a timer until the objectives are achieved and the task completed. Initially it'll be a fun adventure as you burn through tasks and quickly rank up, but with continued play the levequests lose their appeal.\n\nIF YOU START IN UL'DAH, THIS IS PART OF THE STARTING STORY.\n\nWhen it comes to MMOs, what really separates the best from the rest are the ways they keep the entertainment value high over long tracts of time. In the case of levequesting, you're given kill and collection quotas with an extremely thin veneer of story. It won't be long until each quest starts to feel exactly the same. The ways Square Enix attempts to infuse variety – targets fleeing for reinforcements, targets changing form – fall flat. For the first few levels it isn't particularly noticeable since the process of ranking up your class happens fairly quickly. However, once you reach higher levels and realize there are only a handful of quests you'll need to churn through for hours and hours before becoming powerful enough to reach the next camp and quest set, it's difficult to stay motivated. The game does far too little to mask the fact that it's tossed you on a gerbil wheel.\n\nIf you can deal with jumping through the same hoops time and time again, there's at least a difficulty system associated with quests. With a larger group it's best to set the quest for a higher degree of challenge with the notion of potentially earning more skill points for your class. A few other activities exist as well, though their overall effect isn't significant. There's an hourly behest quest that can be taken on, which is essentially a larger-scale version of the levequests. Dungeons lie all over the land, faction quests open up once enough favor is gained, and of course there's always the option to grind solo or in groups, which is as mind-meltingly dull as it's ever been.\n\nONE OF THE MANY STEPS TO CRAFTING.\nThankfully the actual combat is fun to play around with. Since you'll be collecting skills from each class as well as focusing on whichever you prefer, group members can have a diverse range of abilities regardless of class designation. The game also limits the amount of abilities that can be active at one time, meaning you can't just equip everything at once, but must determine which skills work best together. During the slow-paced combat you'll find all the familiar roles – tanks, healers, ranged damage dealers, and those better suited for defeating single and multiple targets. How this system develops over the course of Final Fantasy XIV's life cycle will be interesting to watch, especially aspects like the battle regimen mechanic whereby group members can queue up attacks and then unload on enemies to trigger special effects. Unfortunately a variety of elements, from targeting to input precision, are affected by the game's poorly designed interface and performance issues.\n\nConsidering how frequently you need to interact with the interface in combat and while buying and selling, it's surprising Square Enix decided to build in something so inelegant. For some reason it's required that you open a main menu tab to access any of the critical menus like ability customization menus, gear layout, and quest journals, and there are way too many submenus that must be opened in order to get the simplest of tasks accomplished. In individual cases these don't seem like much but over the span of weeks and months of play it adds up to a dizzying amount of time wasted on navigating the cumbersome menus.\n\nOther mystifying inconveniences include burying your gear's durability status, a near useless overworld map, and making selling items to vendors or exchanging with your retainer an unnecessarily painful process, making you wonder what the developers were thinking when coming up with this. It could be that it'll be the same interface that's eventually put into the PlayStation 3 version, but for PC players it's a perpetual hindrance. Hopefully in the time post-launch Square Enix will take steps to work on this and make character management less of a chore to handle.\n\n\nYet the issues don't end there. A big focus over the coming months will hopefully be with regards to performance optimization. Even on a near top of the line machine the game chugs consistently. If you've got a less powerful machine and turn down the settings, it's unfortunately still a stuttery experience. It's not unplayable, but in outdoor locations especially around Limsa Lominsa, it's something that can't be ignored and that frequently intrudes on the combat and joy of exploration.\n\nThe saddest part is that the game, performance problems aside, is one of the prettiest MMOs I've ever seen. The sandy mesa and rock formations around the dusty stretches of Ul'dah are incredibly detailed, especially as you expand the reach of your travels and discover vast valleys and stunning landscape variation. The tall trees clouding the skies around Gridania aren't quite as impressive when compared against the vast grassy terrain and outcroppings of white rock around Limsa Lominsa, but it's all consistently impressive, especially when you're able to observe the lighting during a sunset along the rim of the world over the silhouette of a sprawling fantastical city.\n\nArmor and weapons designs are equally well detailed, making them all the more alluring beyond the obvious statistical benefits. Animations are smooth and realistic, with characters and enemy types moving about with a sense of weight that helps infuse Eorzea with a degree of realism as you hack away at dodos, marmots, wolves, and more fearsome creatures at higher levels. The soundtracks is also a standout feature, with music that sounds distinctly at home in a Final Fantasy game playing and shifting throughout, and the occasional smattering of voice acting during story missions.\n\nWHAT A TEASE.\n\nIt's important to note that as of right now this is a game built for player versus environment content, so steer clear if you're into competitive player versus player combat. If you're someone who likes to sprint to the highest levels as fast as possible, Square Enix has built in limits. Resources that can be drawn on to fast traveling between camps and cities and special bonuses during quests can be depleted and regenerate slowly, meaning it's best to only play for a few hours per session which, quite honestly, is reasonable.\n\nWhat's odd is that these mechanisms seems to be built to cater to a more casual crowd, though the game is clearly built for a hardcore player with plenty of time to spend. Keep in mind getting anything done of significance in Final Fantasy XIV even at low levels can take an extremely long amount of time, in part because the game is designed to be played at a relaxed pace, but also because you're forced to waste so much time fidgeting with the interface and dealing with lag and performance annoyances. And if after reading all this you're still interested in the game, head over to our review journal for more detail on how everything works.\nVerdict\nWith its newest MMO in its flagship franchise, Square Enix delivers a gigantic, beautiful fantasy world to explore. The flexible class system means you'll be able to mix and match abilities from many different roles so you can change your specialization at will. Much of the promise of the combat system and depth of the crafting mechanics are drowned, unfortunately, under a sea of interface and performance issues that hinder the experience at nearly every step. While there's a lot to consider when building your ideal class, there's far too little interesting structured content to chew on, resulting in an experience that quickly grows tedious and tiresome. All MMOs are designed to keep players logging in for long into the future, but at launch Final Fantasy XIV's questing mechanics feel more like a subway commute than a fun gameplay experience. Patches over the course of the next few months may address many of the technical issues, but for now this is not a world worth visiting.",

    "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening",
    "review": "Playing The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening is an exercise in time travel. Ahead of the Switch remake, I replayed a 2011 version of a 1998 version of the 1993 original. I found the famously inscrutable handheld, top-down Zelda as pleasingly difficult to scrute as ever. Its hazy, Twin Peaks-inspired story and compact, twisting overworld were undimmed by time, but its dungeons were slightly lacking by comparison with what came after, built frustratingly often around just finding hidden areas rather than truly rewarding puzzle solving. But just like a good time-travel yarn, the 2019 remake is out to correct mistakes and make more perfect what came before. I’m happy to say that, having finished this latest version of the story, all of my praise for Link’s Awakening remains intact, and my reservations have practically disappeared.\nThis is a remake in the true sense. The story, and every event in it, is completely intact: it’s an offbeat tale told by turns charmingly and creepily, in which Link is lost at sea and lands on the shores of Koholint Island before an owl sends him to open a giant egg perched atop a mountain. If you haven’t played, this is an odd one. Koholint itself retains every feature from the original – including elements added for the 1998 Game Boy Color re-release – aside from the Camera Shop, which has been made obsolete because we sadly don’t have Game Boy Printers anymore. Even in that case, the Camera Shop area has been reopened as the new Chamber Dungeons location (see boxout below) in its place. Additions are minimal. If you want some guidance as to how minimal, “The crane game has a slightly different layout” was one of the most substantial of my notes about changes.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening - Remake vs. DX Original Comparison\nVIEW 13 IMAGES\nIf you’re a seasoned fan, I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this, but you’re very old. But the upside is that you’ll instantly know how to navigate yourself from the beach Link washes up on, up through the rinky-dink houses of Mabe Village, through the mists of the Mysterious Forest and, eventually, scale Tal Tal Heights to reach the egg of the mysterious Wind Fish. It’s a remarkable work of imitation – the world remains the same, down to individual squares of grass, and music ranges from chiptune-infused covers to gorgeous orchestral reworks of Minako Hamano and Kozue Ishikawa's original jaunty compositions. There’s a real pleasure in seeing what those old pixel sprites ‘really’ looked like, too: those crystals you thought you smashed were actually popped like balloons; that column-rolling globule of a mini-boss looks horribly… wet? At points, this feels as much like digital tourism as it does a return to an old adventure.\nAll Glown Up\nThe real development work, then, has gone into altering the fabric of what makes up those familiar landmarks, and the most immediately obvious change is the new graphical style. Famously, Awakening adds to its dreamlike storyline by pilfering from across the Nintendo Extended Universe – as Link, you stomp Goombas, get eaten by Kirby, and take a Chain Chomp for a walk. It’s fitting, then, that its new look feels drawn from other non-Zelda games, particularly Animal Crossing and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. The chunky 8-bit pixels of old have become a tilt-shifted toy-town, with swathes of blur painted onto the top and bottom of the screen to make Koholint’s dinky architecture and plasticky flora pop out from the screen.\nSome might have worried that the stark charm of the original would be lost in the visual transplant, but it’s simply a new kind of charm now – a style that complements the story by feeling both incredibly cute and uncannily artificial. Even Link’s Awakening’s framing cutscenes have been reworked as miniature anime episodes, emphasising quite how big a shift that style is.\nEvery IGN Zelda Review Score\nVIEW 23 IMAGES\nThe overworld of Koholint Island has also been turned into a single, seamless space. That comes with both pros and one of the remake’s only true cons. On the plus side, it’s a wonderful way to make this place seem more like, well, a place. Where the original was forced by technical restraints into a web of scrolling single-screen areas – one of history’s most beautiful pages of graph paper – those have now been knitted together, making this a true miniature world (again, not unlike Animal Crossing’s tiny landmasses). This changes how the map works, now preferring to reveal whole regions at once rather than unlocking individual grid squares. This has the side effect of making the process of finding where to head next on your quest just a little easier than it used to be. It’s a lovely, modern touch for a game near-obsessed with impersonating the past.\nThe catch is that, in some places, it’s a little too lovely for the Switch to handle. In both handheld and docked mode, framerate regularly dips when there’s a glut of moving elements on screen. Too many waving blades of grass – not exactly uncommon features on the island – and you’ll see performance suffer for it. This was never enough to kill my enjoyment, but it does jar when it begins happening, and it’s rare to go too far in the overworld without experiencing it.\nThe seamlessness of the overworld – and its attendant performance problems – don’t extend to the dungeons, however. These remain knotty and often surprisingly tough sets of single-screen challenges, tying together classic Zelda item-gating with what occasionally amounts to hidden object puzzles. Essentially, you’re as often searching for how to get into a room as you are trying to get through it. They’re also the area of most improvement in the 2019 version.\nThe Biggest Change\nThe only major addition to the fabric of the original game comes in the form of Chamber Dungeons. Completing Link’s Awakening’s underground warrens now allows you to reuse their individual screens like jigsaw pieces, piecing together disparate elements from across Koholint into brand-new challenges. It’s a lovely idea, taking a step towards the Super Zelda Maker we all want. But it is only a step. Chambers themselves can’t be edited, only placed as they were encountered, removing a huge amount of flexibility and much potential for genuinely stumping other players in classic Zelda fashion. There's no theming, meaning you're constantly walking from one dungeon ambience to the next, meaning no creation feels truly your own. Worst, there’s no online sharing functionality, and your creations can only be transferred via Amiibo – meaning the only way I’ll likely get to play a smart stranger’s creation is if they throw an NFC-enabled toy at me in the street. It’s a curiosity, but won’t be a compulsion.\nSpectacular Spelunking\nThe graphical upgrade turns formerly obtuse, dull bits of non-puzzling (such as trying to find a cracked wall or realising a moving platform can be controlled directly) into far more straightforward affairs, all while naturally making the dungeons’ traps, enemies, and tricks more appealingly spectacular. Less obviously, there’s some major quality-of-life work hidden underneath all of this: you can now stamp icons on maps to remind you where to return; locked doors don’t need to be opened again every time you pass through them, and the compass chime used to signal unfound secrets is now far more evident when it goes off. These still aren’t my favourite 2D Zelda dungeons – looking for multiple hidden keys just isn’t as fun as using my specialised equipment to think around an obstacle – but they are absolutely better than they used to be, and it’s entirely down to Nintendo (and regular collaborator Grezzo) working around the original framework of Link’s Awakening.\nThat attention to extraneous detail is found throughout. Most gratifyingly, the Game Boy’s two buttons have been swapped for the Switch’s full set, meaning you no longer need to drop your sword and shield to access other items or equip a gauntlet just pick up a pot. Link does still have to hold a feather to remember how to jump but, given how many games he can’t jump in at all, I’ll let him off for this one. The net result of all this work is that this take on Link’s Awakening can, by comparison, be considered easier than the original – but considering the pitfalls of the original it’s an ease borne out of fairness rather than straight dumbing down, more like evening the odds than rigging them.\nCheck out how similar yet different the Game Boy Color and Switch versions of the game look in the video below:\nAdditions to the original follow a similar rule: the series’ familiar fairy bottles have been added to offer an extra source of health while out in the wilds. There are several more warp points, making fast travel a little more effective than it used to be. There are far more secret seashells – Link’s Awakening’s hidden extra currency – but there’s also a seashell sensor now to make finding where they are a little less of a chore, but without losing the light puzzle aspect of working out how to unearth them when you get there.\nIf all of this sounds small-scale, that’s because it is. From all appearances, overriding interest in every development decision is to preserve the original, and the secondary interest is to make the original even more appealing. You lose nothing, and gain more. This, to me, is a masterclass in how to remake a game.\nWhere to Buy\nThe Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening - Switch\n13\n$54.86 at Walmart\nVerdict\nMy most succinct recommendation for the 2019 remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening would be this: a couple of weeks ago, having finished the original, I was actively hoping that this wouldn’t be a shot-for-shot remake. Entire decades after the fact, the dungeons felt a little underthought, the controls a bit archaic. Even slowly making your way through the overworld by way of set clues, rather than the kind of self-directed navigation we were allowed in A Link Between Worlds, felt old-fashioned. And yet, as I potter once again across Koholint, digging up its last remaining secrets to avoid turning it off again, I’m delighted to have been wrong. Link’s Awakening retains the style and feel of its 1993 self, but looks and controls like a game – albeit a retro-styled one – made in 2019. In doing so, this feels like it was made in some alternate present, where games remained in 2D, puzzle-focused and strange, but tech improved to support it all. You could, I guess, call it time travel.",

    "title": "Uncharted 4: A Thief's End",
    "review": "Update: Uncharted 4: A Thief's End has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year.\nIn amongst its frantic combat, slick parkour, and outrageous action choreography, Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End achieves something wonderful: maturity. This is less a breezy lad’s tale revelling in fortune and glory and more a story about the lads when they’re all grown up, bolstered by an equally developed graphics engine and career-high performances from its cast. A surprisingly assured set of multiplayer modes ices the cake.\nWhat lets it down, however, is an uninspired and overly long third act which slows down its pace considerably with curiously repetitive gameplay. Uncharted 4 consequently falls short of the greatness achieved by some of developer Naughty Dog’s leaner, more inventive predecessors.\nIts 15-hour experience kicks off with focus. Uncharted 4’s story is established in a compelling handful of chapters that weave their way through different time periods with tightly directed cinematic flair. While its setup is overly familiar - Nathan Drake and Elena Fisher are attempting to retire from action-heroism and live a normal life until Nate’s presumed-dead brother turns up with an offer he can’t refuse - a strong emotional throughline is born from the characters’ struggle to reconcile their adult responsibilities with the promise of excitement they secretly crave. Uncharted 4 does a terrific job of exploring a more world-weary group of adventurers, with their concerns and musings layered throughout its quieter moments.\nThese incidental conversations are a marvel. It’s here that we see characters bristle and soften, brought slowly to life with considered writing and a peerless voice cast. Performances from series veterans Nolan North (Nathan Drake), Emily Rose (Elena Fisher), and Richard McGonagle (Victor Sullivan) are as big-hearted as ever, while newcomers Troy Baker (Samuel Drake), Laura Bailey (Nadine Ross), and Warren Kole (Rafe Adler) are nicely understated in more enigmatic roles.\nUncharted 4’s companion characters never break the spell in more frantic or tense sections, either. If you choose to play stealthily, they’ll crouch down in the long grass beside you (and unlike Ellie in The Last of Us, they do an excellent job of staying out of enemy sightlines). If they’re in your way while climbing, they’ll let you clamber over them. They’re competent in gun fights, helpful in traversal, and typically witty throughout. They feel vital.\nSmooth Criminal\nThis level of polish and slickness permeates Uncharted 4. During traversal you can now reach for platforms by controlling Nate like a puppet with the DualShock thumbstick, which leads to fluid, unbroken climbing. A new 4x4 controls well over tricky terrain, and Uncharted 4’s camera worships Nate’s grappling hook, lovingly zooming out as he swings off of cliff faces to bring home a magnificent vista. Steep gravel paths (a personal favourite) send Nate slipping across cliff faces like they were waterslides.\nNaughty Dog has expanded its terrain in order to make the most of these new tools. While I would have enjoyed more to do in this larger land mass - there’s disappointingly little to reward exploration of its various nooks and crannies beyond the occasional sparkling bit of treasure and a great view - I appreciated that occasionally there was more than one pathway to reach my goal. For a series defined by linearity, even the suggestion of choice is refreshing.\nTHERE ARE A COUPLE OF WONDERFULLY CHOREOGRAPHED ACTION SEQUENCES.\nThe same can be said for the stages of more violent action. While you’re occasionally flung into the middle of a group of mercenaries with little to do but shoot your way out, other encounters take place on elaborate adventure playgrounds allowing for more stealthy play. I appreciated the option, even if this is fairly pedestrian and routine stealth gameplay in 2016: characters can be tagged for tracking, long grass is there for silent takedowns, and enemies linger on ledges begging to be grabbed by the ankle from below or kicked off from behind. That’s not to say it’s done poorly – it’s as polished as everything else in Uncharted 4 – it simply doesn’t do anything surprising or interesting. More, considering AI switches to a cautionary state at any sign of trouble, I was disappointed I couldn’t move bodies.\nIf you’re noticed, Uncharted 4’s bad guys will spring into action and distinguish themselves in combat. Open level design allows them to pull relatively intelligent moves like flanking, and they’ll rarely forget you’re there if you try to hide (while hanging off a ledge, for example, they’ll stamp on your hands). Such credible behaviour means you have to keep moving in battle; crouching behind an indestructible pillar to regain your health is no longer feasible. While shooting in Uncharted 4 is satisfying if unremarkable, enemies are now savvy enough – and thankfully less spongy – that there’s a genuine satisfaction born from each kill. It’s fun, frantic stuff.\nSomehow, the visuals keep up with it all. Unlike past Uncharted games where very strict linearity allowed for very carefully orchestrated beauty between stretches of more utilitarian sections built for action, Uncharted 4 manages to be all gorgeous, all the time. The big vistas are predictably impressive, but it’s the little details that really astound: the way snow settles on Nate’s hair, the shocking green of an underwater plant, the reflection cast off of an oil painting. The regularity of such beauty borders on ridiculous: it may be capped at 30 frames per second, but this is the prettiest game I’ve ever played.\nA Thief's End\nWith such strong systems at its disposal, then, it's disappointing that Naughty Dog doesn’t build more theatrical context around them. Regarding the series’ trademark outrageously choreographed action sequences, Uncharted 4’s campaign suffers from a curious lack of imagination. There are bright spots: there’s a brilliant car chase in Madagascar and a vertigo-inducing section involving clambering up a clock tower that really stand out. But otherwise the thrills here tend to be of a more predictable nature: lots of handholds breaking at the last minute, buildings coming down, an occasional easily solved puzzle in an opulent interior. It’s 2016, and after three Uncharteds (and two contemporary Tomb Raiders) we’ve seen it all before.\nThis becomes a big problem in Uncharted 4’s third act, where the pacing slows down to a crawl. This jungle section is repetitive, and Nate and friends do little in it but climb and shoot, rinse and repeat. After a while, every encounter blurred into one amorphous amalgamation of shootouts, cliff faces, and pushing crates off of ledges for your companion to clamber up. As it’s the longest section in Uncharted 4, it eventually became a slog.\nThings pick up significantly by the end. The thoughtful exploration of these characters and their relationships with each other has a subtle payoff which bucks against the typical action coda, and it’s to Naughty Dog’s credit that it’s unafraid to stay true to its characters and their motivations, even if they aren’t as explosive as one might expect.\nUNCHARTED 4'S VISUALS ASTOUND.\nAfter The End\nThere’s not much to do in the main campaign once you’ve finished it, bar completing your treasure collection, but there’s extended life to be had in Uncharted 4’s confident 5v5 and 4v4 multiplayer. Though it’s still a sideshow to the main campaign in scope, its four modes – Team Deathmatch, Plunder, Command, and Ranked Team Deathmatch – embody the series’ most enjoyable qualities: camaraderie (your teammates can be revived when in a downed state), sheets of bullets, and a constant sense of momentum. On the latter point, it helps that the stages for play have been opened up from previous games thanks to the grappling hook: zipping around to high vantagepoints to get the drop on enemies lends itself to a dizzying sense of verticality.\nDeathmatch is ranked, which lends competitive longevity and appropriate skill matchmaking to Uncharted 4’s multiplayer, but Plunder and Command are the most fun. Command is a map-domination variant that places greater emphasis on teamwork by putting a target on the back of the strongest player in each team - the ‘captain.’ As you try and capture territories and hunt the enemy’s captain, you also have to protect against the opposing team trying to kill yours. You’ve got to be even more alert than usual, even as you’re pursuing an objective.\nPlunder works similarly to previous Uncharteds, where the goal is to carry an idol to a central point on the map before the other team reaches it with theirs. Slowly heaving an idol to your teammate across a giant ravine while being shot at on all sides makes for a hilarious contrast in pace.\n\nA sense of chaos is further encouraged by the outrageous abilities you can now harness in all of Uncharted 4’s multiplayer modes. Spending earned points to temporarily wield supernatural powers like teleportation, which hurtles you across the map, and summon a sarcophagus that attacks the enemy with flying evil spirits can totally interrupt the rhythms of what would otherwise be a normal firefight.\n\nThe AI sidekicks available for every player are a clever new addition, too. Instead of buying flashy powers, you can summon enormously handy AI-controlled helpers in battle. They’re capable of fulfilling basic tasks like sniping, brute-force shooting, and healing – as well as giving your opponents something to shoot at that isn’t your head. If you’re up against them, there’s a franticness born from trying to take them down while being attacked from all sides.\nIt plays beautifully. Because it runs at 60fps, the shooting feels better than it does in the main campaign, and there’s just as much fluidity to scaling walls and swinging, but now with a palpable smoothness. Naughty Dog does a great job at twisting familiar environments from the main campaign into interesting shapes across eight maps: soaring through the air against a boundless Mediterranean sea before leaping into the opulence of an Italian auction house – all the while shooting at other players – is exhilarating.\n\nThese maps are well suited for shootouts, leaping, and magic powers. Wide open spaces peppered with lookout spots make for dramatic shootouts, winding corridors under heaving pirate ships are there for intimate encounters, and spots for the grappling hook are everywhere, meaning every game feels alive with motion.\n\nWhile it’s difficult to say what Uncharted 4’s multiplayer will look like in the future, there are enough unlockables and perks to act as a carrot for completionists, and Naughty Dog has promised more maps, mysticals, and a co-op mode in the future that I’ll be sticking around for.\nVerdict\nUncharted 4: A Thief’s End is a remarkable achievement in blockbuster storytelling and graphical beauty. Though it’s let down by a lack of imagination and some self-indulgence, especially in a third act that drags on far too long, Uncharted 4 carries on the series’ proud tradition of peerless polish and style, with a great multiplayer component to boot. Most importantly, it’s a gentle sendoff to the rag-tag group of characters we’ve known for nine years. A worthy thief’s end, indeed.",

    "title": "Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker",
    "review": "As of this moment -- as I sit typing on my keyboard -- I'm 35 hours into Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, and the game only has more to show me. I beat the story at the 17-hour mark or so, but with more than 100 Extra Ops serving as mini-games/challenges, my own Metal Gear to mold and customize, a platoon of 350 soldiers, dozens of hands-off Outer Ops missions to send troops out on and so much more, I don't know when I'll put this game down.\n\nMetal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is probably the biggest game in the Metal Gear series, and it's only on Sony's smallest system.\n\nGrab your gun and watch the video review.\n\nMetal Gear Solid: Peace Walker picks up the story of Naked Snake (AKA Big Boss) after the events of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops. It's 1974, and Snake's a bit disenchanted. After killing his \"traitorous\" mentor the Boss in Metal Gear Solid 3, Snake left the United States and founded Militaires Sans Frontieres, or soldiers without borders, a militia of sorts that takes on causes and missions for those who need their help. Soon, a professor and student show up begging for assistance. It seems that the CIA has invaded Costa Rica, and seeing as how the country doesn't have a military, the duo needs MSF to step in and set things right. Snake balks at the offer, but when the professor plays a tape that seemingly proves the Boss is alive, MSF takes the contract.\n\nThis conversation, which is pretty much one cutscene, sets up one of the Metal Gear franchise's best stories. One of the most common complaints about Metal Gear games is the convoluted stories. Who are the Patriots? Who's related to whom? What the hell is happening? Peace Walker doesn't go down that path. Snake takes this mission to find out if the Boss is alive. This is a man who is still visibly shaken over the events of Snake Eater. He loved this woman but had to kill her for his country. He's jaded, hurt and angry. He openly cries about what happened and needs to know what drove his mentor to work with the Soviets.\n\nThat's your motivation in this game. Sure, Snake wants to stop a Metal Gear from launching a nuke and killing millions, but he really wants to answer the questions that have plagued him since that epic battle in the field of lilies.\n\nThis plays out in traditional, third-person Metal Gear gameplay. You'll take Snake though jungles and riverbeds while popping bad guys with tranquilizer darts or bullets. You can crouch so that you can slowly and stealthily make your way through levels, hold up bad guys, choke opponents out, and so on. As always, this is a stealth game, so your goal is to complete the mission objective without being seen or heard. If the guards get wind of you, they'll go on alert, call in backup, and make your life miserable.\n\nTHE PENCIL-DRAWN FLASHBACKS ARE BEAUTIFUL.\nOf course, it's not entirely the same old – but awesome – thing here. Snake's still packing his close quarters combat moves, but I found them easier and more useful than ever in Peace Walker. When you can execute a CQC action, you just hold the right shoulder button and latch onto the opponent with a sleeper hold. From here, you can threaten him with a stun rod or use the new throw move to hurl him into walls (an instant knockout) or into other people. If there are others around, you can chain your CQC moves together with a timed button press for rad combination animations where Snake flips dudes and disarms them.\n\nAs I've already written about, this game is huge. You're building MSF in this game – creating the infamous stronghold known as Outer Heaven that Solid Snake will have to destroy in the original Metal Gear – so another tweak on gameplay this time around is having to capture enemies to fill out your squadron. In Portable Ops, you did this in a way – knock guys out, drag them to your truck, and they'd be available to play with – but here, it's streamlined. You knock the guy out, hook him up to a Fulton balloon, and a helicopter snatches him out of the sky while you continue on the mission. This is beyond addictive. Even when my squad was teeming with people, I'd go out of my way to capture everyone I could, which includes hidden POWs in every level.\n\n\nWhat are you capturing all of these guys for? They're the lifeblood of the game. You'll snatch these men and women and then get to assign them to divisions of your army – combat, research and development, intel, and so on – based on the multitude of stats that each character has. Guys assigned to your combat unit can take Snake's place in missions or be dispatched in Outer Ops; and R&D folks develop new weapons, items and upgrades. Keep recruiting, keep getting better people into these divisions, and you'll keep getting cooler crap.\n\nIt's like crack. I can't tell you how many of my hours I've spent with this game just sorting troops by their ability to make food so that I can make sure I have the best mess hall so that my crew is happy. I pick up POWs and pray that they're the \"S-rank\" troops I've been looking for to really pull my R&D department together and get me the final upgrades I need.\n\nClick here and watch all the crazy crap in this game.\n\nPeace Walker puts an emphasis on shorter gameplay sessions, so each mission is its own task. You'll select the one you want to go out on, get a cutscene if it calls for it, go out on your mission, and get a stat screen grading you on the number of alerts before getting booted back to the menu. This is a nice change of pace for a number of reasons – first and foremost because it gives you control over your loadout for each scenario you're entering. Oddly, you can't save mid-mission, and that might be a drag as some battles go on for a while.\n\nAs you unlock and find different suits for Snake, you're going to want to wear them in specific situations. See, the suits are better/worse for certain areas when it comes to camouflage (jungle vs. urban), they allow you to carry different numbers of items and weapons, and some have unique abilities (in the sneaking suit, you can move as fast as you want and be completely silent). Because the missions are self-contained, you can use your weapon-limited sneak suit to get through an entire level, have the level end as you get your first glimpse of a boss, and then start the \"new\" mission where you fight the boss and have your battle suit armed along with its extra weapon and item slots. It's awesome, and key to dominating missions.\n\nThe missions being broken up is great for the PSP because Peace Walker is phenomenal at dangling carrots in front of your face. When these missions end, you return to Mother Base where you're inundated with information – what your research and development team has created in the way of weapons and items, how the troops you dispatched on missions fared, who has come to join your army, and so on.\n\nThe game is insanely deep.\n\nAdding to all of this is the focus on co-op. Every mission in Peace Walker – whether it be a story mission or one of the 100-plus Extra Ops – is available for you and a buddy to conquer. Co-op is only available via ad-hoc, but it's still a nice option. If it's a boss battle (a tank, a helicopter or a Metal Gear), four players can set out to best the beast. Whatever you do as a team, you benefit from as a player. If you Fulton out seven players total, you each get those seven players for your squad. If one of you climbs inside an AI core and unlocks a bunch of memory boards to use in your personal Metal Gear, you all get those boards.\n\nCo-op is great. I'm a single-player fan and didn't know if I'd dig playing with others, but marching around levels capturing bad guys and decimating bosses is a blast with friends.\n\nHowever, co-op leads to one of my main complaints with Peace Walker – and I only have two. This co-op focus means that some of the game is a pain in the ass (if not entirely undoable) by yourself. I've seen a ton of other game critics – folks I know can play – struggle and scream over some of the boss battles in this game. For me, I thought they were crazy until I came to the second battle with the final boss – Peace Walker itself. On my third attempt, I played for 45 minutes before running out of ammo and having the mission called off.\n\nThe curse words I screamed would make Dennis Leary blush.\n\nTHE GAMEPLAY YOU KNOW IS HERE AND AWESOME.\nIn the end, I couldn't beat Peace Walker without the help of another player who was way past that point. That shouldn't be an aspect of a game like this. It's perfectly fine to make the Extra Ops super-difficult – and trust me, the repeat battles with tanks and the Cocoon are – but a solo player should be able to get through the story by him or herself. Granted, you might be able to replay missions and upgrade your weapons so that certain bosses wouldn't give you much trouble, but I'm no rookie and I don't think that I should've been dealing with the trouble I was dealing with.\n\nThe second issue with Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker? It's almost too deep for its own good. Don't get me wrong, the depth is one of this game's greatest assets – I won't stop playing until my army has conquered all of the Outer Ops – but there isn't much in the way of guidance. There are really, really general tutorials in the game, but they don't give you an adequate idea of how to make trades with other players, how to make your own Metal Gear songs, or how to make the most of the mechs you've acquired. To learn these tenets of the game, you have to either go through some trial and error or have a \"Big Boss\" on hand to walk you through the game.\n\nOf course, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker doesn't stop there. On this UMD (or digital download for you cool kids) is a pimped out competitive multiplayer mode where you can go head to head with five other friends in games of deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture and base defense. The modes are fun, but they didn't do much for me – it's just Metal Gear Online, which is no small feat for a portable game. If you can get six Peace Walker fanatics together at one time, have at it, but the game is more about co-op in my eyes.\nVerdict\nHere’s the thing – I could write another nine pages on Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. I could do it with ease. From the missions that have you listening to bird calls to the missions that have you taking photos of ghosts to missions that have you holding people up with bananas, this game is insanely deep. It’s crazy and I want to go on and on about every little thing, but there’s no reason for me to sit here and spoil it for you.\nMetal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is awesome and you need to play it. It’s not perfect, as the co-op is nearly mandatory in some spots and I could’ve done with a better “how to guide,” but this game is a masterpiece. Not only is it in the running for the title of greatest game ever on the PSP, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker is one of the greatest games in the entire Metal Gear franchise.",

    "title": "Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward",
    "review": "For those of us looking for great storytelling in a role-playing game, massively multiplayer RPGs have usually been the black sheep of the genre's family. Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward, the first major expansion for 2013’s FFXIV: A Realm Reborn, breaks that trend, and does so admirably. While the main story of A Realm Reborn is nothing to frown on, Heavensward takes that foundation and pushes it toward the heavens to emerge as the finest Final Fantasy tale that developer Square Enix has told in a decade. That's especially helpful here, as it helps outshine some of the expansion's rough leveling slog and Square Enix's decision to gate the new combat classes behind hours of pre-expansion story content.\nIt's important to note that the impact of the story hinges a lot on knowing the personalities and backgrounds of various characters from the initial story content for A Realm Reborn, and thus Square Enix made the unusual decision to require players to finish all of the main story content from patches prior to the expansion. For anybody who’s been subscribed and actively playing this whole time, that's not a problem, and brand-new players who've bought the expansion ahead of time will be grateful for the roughly three levels of XP the 16 or so hours of level 50 content yield on the journey from levels 50 to 60. On the other hand, if you're coming back to FFXIV with a level 50 character after an absence of several months, as I was, the catch-up work and delayed gratification required can be daunting.\n\nBut, I've found, it's worth it. A Realm Reborn's final string of level 50 patches hinted at the quality of writing that comes in Heavensward, and reaching the moment when the gates to the new realm of Ishgard open rightly feels like a momentous event. The story of Heavensward itself explores themes of betrayal, redemption, and hidden truths in a reclusive realm with surprising dexterity, and it wraps it all in one of the finest tales about dragons in any medium. In Heavensward, one of A Realm Reborn's most one-dimensional characters becomes one of the saga's most complex as he wrestles with guilt over his former arrogance. Elsewhere, devious scheming leads to welcome romps in the zones from before the expansion. It’s not without stretches of padding, of course, and events occur that leave the most memorable storyline leading up the expansion stripped of its initial power. But with its enjoyable corresponding cutscenes and hints of related events yet to come, even this relative narrative low-point moment has its appeal.\n\nSo I can forgive that choice, but the practice of gating the three new combat \"jobs\" of Dark Knight, Machinist, and Astrologian behind that 16 hours of level 50 story content as well stings much more. It makes some sense from a lore perspective, as these are Ishgard-specific classes, but waiting that long is a sure buzzkiller if you’ve mainly come back to FFXIV to play the new classes, only to find that you still have to put many more hours into jobs you were already tired of despite being at the previous level cap. Even worse, the requirement to finish all that content first means that I missed out on all the XP the story quests could have given at least one of those new jobs. Seeing as how there was already an Ishgardian zone in A Realm Reborn in the form of the Coerthas Central Highlands, it seems possible that Square could have just placed the trainers and their quests there and thus allowed access to the classes before the gates of Ishgard even opened.\n\nAs for the classes themselves, they're fun – and I wish I'd had the opportunity to play through the whole expansion as the gunslinging Machinist instead of my arrow-flinging Bard, although both currently seem a bit weak in comparison to other jobs. The tanky Dark Knight at last introduces the \"big sword\" class that so many players have been wanting, and the Astrologian is a healer with tarot-like animations that are just as fun to watch on the sidelines. (They, too, seem a bit weak.) Fortunately, not all such related content is gated; if you wish, you can level a new character (or pay for a race change) as a member of the new Au Ra race, whose human features and scales and horns recall the dragons at the center of the expansion.\nAmong the chief attractions of Heavensward are a variety of stunning new zones that complement this tale of dragons and the occasional wild tribe. It starts out predictably enough, with the same snowy landscapes we saw before the expansion, but then the story whisks us off to surreal landscapes where rocks float about the sky as though in a painting by Magritte. From the towering Gothic spires of Ishgard itself to the hovering peak of Sohm Al, Heavensward is full of visual surprises.\n\nTrue to the expansion's name, these are landscapes meant for flying, especially with the new black chocobo mounts you get early on in the story. I'm generally not a big fan of flying mounts on account of their tendency to take us out of the \"living\" world, but the concept works well enough here since so much of Heavensward's content centers on the aforementioned floating rocks that make getting around on foot a bit of a pain. I do, however, like how Heavensward makes you work for the privilege of flying by gathering \"aether currents\" through exploration and quests, resulting in real satisfaction when my chocobo first pointed its beak towards the sky.\nMore Reviews\nRocket League Review – Updated\nDec 5, 2017 - What a save!

That's partially because Square Enix designed the leveling content between 50 and 60 to take roughly as long as 1 to 50 did in A Realm Reborn, but also because it once again falls into the trap of grindy, unfulfilling content when you get close to the level cap. In my review of A Realm Reborn in 2013, my chief criticism was that there was an overemphasis on FFXIV's dynamic FATE events from levels 40 to 50. Here, on the other hand, Square fills the spaces in-between the new story missions at every level with an excess of dull side quests with comparatively meager XP rewards from 55 to 59. As for the expansion's new FATEs, they're so unrewarding that almost no one seems to bother with them. (Somewhat hilariously, though, you'll still find a sea of mid-50 players grinding out the old FATEs in A Realm Reborn's Northern Thanalan, so good is the XP even now.) For so much of the stretch from 55 to 59, Heavensward insists on forcing us to undertake a load of filler quests for adorable \"moogles,\" which generally amount to finding other moogles or taking an item to, yes, another moogle on the other side of the map. It's insipid stuff, and it's almost insulting considering the strength of the main story content. It was so dull, in fact, that I contented myself with running the level-specific four-man dungeons of The Aery and The Great Gubal Library over and over until I overcame the level hurdles instead.\n\nI don't regret that, in part because the dungeons were so fun. Heavensward might have a great single-player story, but it also shows that Square Enix hasn't forgotten that FFXIV's main focus is overcoming challenges with other players. It hit me harder in this regard than most MMO expansions, kicking off with a required hard-mode battle with a new primal at level 53 that's complicated enough that I've seen multiple groups fail entirely. But it's also quite satisfying to beat, and it hints at what challenges Square Enix might have in store for us with coming patches. The four-man dungeons maintain this momentum with fun battles and occasionally memorable settings, complete with squabbles with key figures from the lore. It all culminates in a final battle that's as challenging as it is unexpected.\n\nThat's all true of the leveling content; now all we have to do is wait to see if Square Enix can maintain this pleasing mix of story, dungeon design, and fun through upcoming content updates. As great as these individual components are, they're not terribly different from what's already in FFXIV; and in fact, the new flying mounts, the new race, and the new jobs represent the only genuinely new features. But that also means that this an expansion in the truest sense of the word, and it does its job well.\nVerdict\nFinal Fantasy XIV: Heavensward doesn't make sweeping changes to A Realm Reborn aside from new jobs and flying mounts, but the outstanding story it tells and new lands we visit reinvigorate the adventure and demonstrate why Final Fantasy XIV is one of the best MMOs out there. Not every side quest is a winner, but the exemplary journey to the new level cap is a model for all other MMO expansions to follow.

    "title": "The Sims 2",
    "review": "The Sims was one of those games that you just didn't see coming. It smacked the gaming world upside the head with its quirky nature and long reaching appeal. Obviously, the success of the original was so high that it was a forgone conclusion that The Sims 2 would eventually hit stores after the billions of expansion packs were done selling for the first game. Finally, after four years of waiting, The Sims 2 is coming out. We've had a final for quite a while now and have been playing the crap out of it in order to write this review.\nThe Sims 2 is a strange game to try and review. There are a lot of different ways to look at it and play it. The only thing that's certain is that this series is one of a kind. I can honestly say that I don't think I \"got it\" when the original game was released. I enjoyed it for a while but became frustrated at how hard it was to juggle relationships, bathroom breaks, and sleep time in order to get to the top of the corporate food chain. But over the last few weeks, I finally discovered something, partly due to a lot of the improvements made over the first game. The Sims isn't about \"winning\" or reaching a certain goal. It's about setting up experiences and watching them unfold. It's about personality and creativity and The Sims 2 handles both in a way that can't help but make you stare in wonder at this brilliantly bizarre series.\nThe most obvious addition is the new engine. It was an easy decision for them to make the game better looking. Not only did it help them keep up with the technology but more importantly helped them create an experience with a lot more personality and flair than The Sims was ever capable of supplying. All of the items found in The Sims 2 are amazingly detailed and vibrantly colorful, but the real charmer is the hugely long list of interactive animations between sims and the environment.\nVideo Review Available In Sims 2 you do not read. You interact. You experience the visual world that unfolds before you. A text review may suffice, but why not treat your eyes to tons of direct-feed video and your ears to detailed commentary from IGNPC's Editor-in-Chief?\nDownload It Now\nHow can you not smile at the different ways the sims dance depending on their personalities? How can you not be pleased when outgoing characters are giving other sims in the room a thumbs up as they walk by? How can you not throw a fit of laughter when a man in a top hat and a cute blonde teenager burp in each other's faces for fun? There are so many wonderful animations of the cute, disgusting, touching, playful, exciting, amazing, and clever things that we see in life right there on the screen for your virtual people to act out. The combination of actions happening in the house can be downright hilarious and bizarre. If you haven't read the SimIGN piece about the IGNPC guys living in a house together, you should check it out to see what I mean.\nIMAGEURL=HTTP%3A%2F%2FPCMEDIA.IGN.COM%2FPC%2FIMAGE%2FARTICLE%2F546%2F546893%2FTHE-SIMS-2-20040910060107283-000.JPG&CAPTION=\nThe Sims 2 is a brilliant simulation but also a wonderful caricature of life in general. And that's what you have to remember when playing this game. It isn't about completing a lofty goal of saving the world. Not reaching the top rung of the corporate ladder doesn't mean you failed. A dirty house and toilet isn't the end of the world. This game is about experimentation and creativity, whether you're setting up relationships or building a crazy house. You can almost equate it to a very strange canvas. Maxis is selling some amazing tools to create all kinds of things from architecture to full blown stories. It's up to the gamer to take those tools and use them however they see fit.\nAnd that's the most difficult thing to understand. As I said earlier, I didn't really understand when I was playing the first game. I was used to playing games that have specific goals. The Sims 2 declares that having goals is almost a distraction to having fun. Don't get me wrong, if you want to think of the game that way, it's possible. You can move your sims up to the top of the corporate food chain, help your sim-kids and teenagers get into private school, or even complete abstract goals of affording the best TV on the list. But those are side shows to the main events of watching the personalities interact and sharing experiences with the community.\nMaxis added several different features to improve on the original and improve on it they do. The first of these is the ability to use either one of three prepared neighborhoods with an interesting background or create your own from scratch using one of several neighborhood terrains. Players can now create different sized lots, place houses, community centers, and environmental items like balloons, rocks, trees, clouds, birds, and so on.\nThe neighborhood story can be added to, modified, and made creative easily with their new story creation tool. This tool works not only for the neighborhood, but also for each individual house. The game also adds a movie making feature which allows players to explore their inner director. It isn't the easiest to make perfect movies, but with a little practice, there's sure to be some great movies online before too long. You can even use a simple movie editing tool like Windows Movie Maker (which comes with Windows XP) to edit the files into a coherent movie of some sort. The only thing that might be a concern is that taking high quality movies with this tool will slow down lower spec machines. Even on my Athlon 64, with a Gig of Ram and a GeForce 5900 Ultra, the game ran fairly chuggy while taking high quality movies. The movies were certainly passable, but weren't completely smooth because all of that was happening on the same computer. Still, it's certainly a welcome feature for players that don't have the resources to buy an extra computer to capture and record video.\nBut what would the stories or movies be without characters and drama? Maxis has added loads more of each on top of the story creation tools. Take the character creation tool. It's about a thousand times better than The Sims original. While players won't be able to adjust height or limb length (without developer cheats) because of requirements to make animations look natural, they will be able to have an unprecedented amount of face customization. There are so many deformation points and options that it'll be hard for players not to play with the tool for hours.\nI had several of my friends give the game a whirl over the last couple of weeks to see their reactions and how easy the tool was to use for those that hadn't seen it before and the reaction was quite good. My fiance spent a good hour and a half simply playing with this feature and experimenting, happy the entire time. I can guarantee that I've personally spent at least 8-10 hours doing that myself. The range of faces players will be able to create is extreme. Some of the faces can be downright disturbing and then watching those sims breed with other sims to create half-breed freaks is even more disturbing and fun.\nIMAGEURL=HTTP%3A%2F%2FPCMEDIA.IGN.COM%2FPC%2FIMAGE%2FARTICLE%2F546%2F546893%2FTHE-SIMS-2-20040910060056846-000.JPG&CAPTION=\nThe addition of breeding, genetics, and aging is also a big move from the original. The idea of having genetics in each character created for use in combining them into children born in the game is brilliant. It completely adds to the ability to be immersed in the drama and life of a neighborhood. The neighborhood will expand and grow over time as adult sims hook up and have kids. You can actually see the generations pass as they get older. The only draw back is the aging process, which means sims you like will eventually up and die if you don't cheat or use one of the aspiration rewards called the Elixir of Life that reverses aging by a few days.\nThe addition of several age brackets means there are a lot more types of kids. Babies, toddlers, children, and teenagers fill out the ranks with adults and old age closing out the rotation. And while there were kids in the original, they weren't implemented as thoroughly. They'll all have to go to school and do homework as you would expect, but parents will also have the option to encourage their behavior in certain ways and help them grow as people. This doesn't mean it all has to be positive either. If one of the parents is a cranky bastard, that trait could be encouraged as well, leaving some seriously funny results. One family I created called the Zoo's (originally because they were all freaks, but later because they captured and caged innocents walking past the house) were such a bad family to the toddler (I usually take a fairly hands off approach to guiding sims) that it grew up to be an incredible brat, throwing tantrums and causing problems. Of course, he wasn't happy when he found himself in a cage either, but them's the breaks.\nThe last very important addition to the gameplay is the idea of aspirations. When creating sims, and when children become teenagers, lifetime aspirations must be picked. These add on top of personalities to create interesting mixes. For example, a lazy and sloppy sim with a financial aspiration may find it more difficult to make money than an active, outgoing, and neat sim. Basically, these act as guideposts for players and sims. Each aspiration will govern wants. Each sim has four wants at all times and three fears. Completing these wants helps sims reach a level of mood that even needs won't effect their happiness. Points gathered from achieving wants also allows sims to purchase special aspiration rewards that could potentially help sims become better and also provide some great entertainment.\nBasically, theses additions help give some direction without forcing players to pay attention to them. Those sims that have met their aspirations when progressing into the next age bracket of their life will have a better time of it than those that haven't.\nNow, a lot of players complained about The Sims for AI reasons. Sims in the original would often forget to go to the bathroom or some such thing causing micromanaging issues. Most sims will now take care of all of these needs without much handholding, allowing players to sit back and enjoy the action and spend most of their time helping sims get what they want or get what they fear (if you're that kind of a person).\nThis is actually one of those games that I don't feel bad about cheating in. It actually allows players to set up their neighborhood the way they choose before diving into the interactions. Sure, every area has some poor people, but the mansion on the hill that you'll like to have some mean, snooty, rich people inhabiting would take a lifetime to fill. Cheats actually allow players to paint a picture before they enter and play, which I like in this case.\nIMAGEURL=HTTP%3A%2F%2FPCMEDIA.IGN.COM%2FPC%2FIMAGE%2FARTICLE%2F546%2F546893%2FTHE-SIMS-2-20040910060053814-000.JPG&CAPTION=\nOn top of all of this, Maxis also made sure to add enough community features to keep what is easily one of the biggest online gaming communities in the world quite happy. The game hasn't been released yet, so there isn't anything to download at the moment, but EA will be hosting servers for players to upload their content. When there are new items and skins for download available, players will be able to easily click on a snowflake icon in game to download any content that might be available. All of this custom content, including full sim designs, will be recognizable by the snowflake symbol in their iconic representation in-game. So if you're adding a looking to add new floor and you see an option with a snowflake next to it, you'll know it's a custom texture.\nVerdict\nIt's really hard to shove all that's available in The Sims 2 into a neat packaged review. It is, however, easy to start rambling about all of the cool ass things that happen during the course of play. I've laughed so hard and been so disturbed that I simply have to recommend this game to anybody who was a fan of the The Sims. Even if you weren't, as I wasn't as much as some people, might find more to enjoy with this second installment.\nThe new features like aging, aspirations, character design, community property, and all of the great story building tools help to make The Sims 2 a more complete game in every way possible.\nAll of the superb personality and feeling that the game delivers with its graphics and animations only pushes my feelings higher. I've played The Sims 2 for a good 50 hours now and am sure that I haven't seen everything there is to see. When you see imaginary bunnies and doctors fall from the sky to help with mental health, you'll know you arrived.\nIf you're looking for a game that really and truly lets you create your own story and build your own history and world, this is the one for you. The series is unique and lovely, and while the premise may be four years old, the feeling you get when playing The Sims 2 isn't.",

    "title": "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword",
    "review": "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is the greatest Zelda game ever created. It's the best game for Wii and one of the finest video game accomplishments of the past 10 years. The game has once again raised the bar and forged new territory for an iconic and innovative franchise. It's not enough that it finally establishes a powerful, stirring origin story or that it features near-perfect pacing. What puts Skyward Sword over the top is its layered, dense, absolutely perfect gameplay that manages to not only nail motion-controlled combat but remarkably offers a stunning level of diversity.\nEvery story has a beginning, and The Legend of Zelda is no exception - we simply hadn't been privy to it until now. Nintendo is finally willing to take a look at Hyrule's distant past, focusing on a Link and Zelda who are childhood friends before, as you might expect, something goes horribly off track. Link then embarks on a quest with the fate of the world - and his friend - in the balance.\n\nSkyward Sword sets a new, important benchmark for Nintendo. Modern video games have made significant strides in how they present stories to audiences, and it seems as though Nintendo has finally taken notice. Skyward Sword features cinematics that play out like a movie. At times they are downright captivating with their picturesque settings and powerful drama. The game lacks voice acting as always, but characters' emotions shine through regardless, and the framing of scenes is incredible. As the story moves into its final act, you'll be stunned at the quality on display here. This is easily Nintendo's best storytelling to date.\n\nThe tale is, at heart, fairly simple. An evil entity wants to destroy peace, love and happiness, and Link is going to make sure that doesn't happen. It's not so much the plot that's important but the people in it. Skyward Sword's characters are phenomenal. Link is his usual mute self, more of an avatar for the player than anything else, but everyone surrounding him is remarkably memorable and charming. Zelda herself is by far the star of the show and her relationship with Link early on forms the backbone of the entire game. You want Link to succeed not so much because you're worried about saving what will eventually become Hyrule, but because you genuinely care that he cares about Zelda.\n\nYOU HAVE A LONG JOURNEY AHEAD, LINK.\n\n\nThe same could be said for most of the supporting cast. Fi, a spirit that functions as Link's advisor and guide, is a spectacular creation, probably best likened to a benevolent GLaDOS. Though primarily designed to give players direction and tips, Fi is actually a great source of humor as she fails to understand human emotion and reports brutally honest statistical percentages on your likelihood of success. Smaller roles, such as the couple dozen inhabitants of Skyloft, are so distinct and colorful you'll likely remember them despite their insignificance to the larger plot. Between day and night cycles as well as the ever-shifting narrative, there are plenty of side quests for Link to pursue - and that's to say nothing about the wider world, above and below the clouds.\n\nPairing itself with Wii MotionPlus, Skyward Sword's 1:1 combat is a revelation. I never want to play a Zelda game any other way again, and playing through this makes me wonder why we didn't see motion control of this quality before. The responsiveness and intuitiveness of the entire arrangement is superb. The applications of Motion Plus never step into gimmicky territory. Guiding your mechanical flying Beetle, rolling bombs, swimming in water and soaring through the sky by pivoting and flicking the remote not only feels natural, it makes you wonder how you ever played an action game that wasn't on Wii. Zelda: Skyward Sword is the purest, most perfect realization of Nintendo's ambitious goals for motion-controlled gaming. It somehow took five years, but the definitive proof plays out before you on the screen.\n\nThe new combat system requires skill and patience. Though impulsive, unpredictable waggling can get some results, most enemies are programmed to react to such behavior, and they'll punish you for it. On occasion my temper would get the best of me against an enemy, but swinging my remote faster didn't help. Some enemies anticipate your moves or use their weapons to block certain attacks, making routine fights far more challenging and complicated than in past Zelda games. None of your enemies are overtly difficult, but the added complexity, combined with more sophisticated puzzles and world designs, make each victory that much sweeter. What Ocarina of Time started with lock-on targeting, Skyward Sword perfects by adding layers of nuanced strategy. You'll rarely die, but you'll find yourself working hard to defeat and out-maneuver your opponents.\n\nCombat isn't the only area of the game that's become more thought-provoking. Nintendo has changed the concept of dungeons and the overworld itself. Previously, a wide open mainland would branch off to smaller areas that would lead to vast dungeons. That concept effectively ends in Skyward Sword. Though the sky realm is a huge area to navigate, it's generally just used as a way to access different regions in the land below. The game wisely implements a quick travel system early on, allowing Link to rapidly access areas he has already explored and removing a potentially tedious element. There is a slight disconnect between the earthly realms, but that does serve to add a sense of wonder about the unknown, particularly when huge areas of your map remain blank.\n\nFI IS A MASTERFUL COMPANION AND A BRILLIANT ADDITION TO THE ZELDA FRANCHISE.\n\n\nThe changes don't end there. Not only is travel faster, but the surface world packs in an enormous amount of content. Taking a page from Metroid, Skyward Sword requires you to travel repeatedly back to familiar environments, each time altering some key attribute or providing you with new tools to make the experience completely fresh. New areas and paths lead to vast, unexplored territory that is just as deep, important and engrossing as any of the material that preceded it. Combat aside, Nintendo's greatest achievement in Skyward Sword just might be its new approach to designing its worlds. Arriving at dungeons and temples now takes hours, and none of that time is wasted. The sheer brilliance on display here, evident more and more as you journey deeper into the game, will stun even the most jaded gamer.\n\nDungeons are now smaller, and tired staples like lighting torches and endlessly pushing blocks are largely absent in favor of far more creative concepts that frequently use all of the items at Link's disposal. Some dungeons even relish forcing you to methodically work one item to the next, a reminder that you have many tools at your disposal. Skyward Sword's dungeons not only manage to progressively get better, they're some of the most genius designs ever seen in the Zelda series. The final temple just might be the best Nintendo has ever created.\nDespite their polarizing, standard definition nature, Skyward Sword's visuals count amongst its strongest points. Nintendo has finally found a style that perfectly embodies the Zelda series. By capturing the maturity of Twilight Princess and the vibrant, youthful energy of Wind Waker, this franchise now has the perfect outlet to fully express itself without compromise. Full of bizarre, quirky characters as well as creatures from the darkness, Nintendo has found a tone that captures the best of both ideas while still serving the most important element of all - the gameplay.\n\nGreat graphics don't always revolve around polygon counts and high-res textures. Where Skyward manages to excel, and completely overcome its hardware limitations, is its creative and inventive art direction. The minimalist approach not only serves the game's tone but allows the designers to come up with outlandish environments and creatures that wouldn't work in a more realistic setting. Animation and character expressions are equally well done, and are largely responsible for why the game's cinematics work so effectively. Nintendo also implemented a clever, distance-based filter that blurs objects and scenery further in the background. Though initially jarring, it actually has a rather painterly quality to it that hides its attempt to help Wii cope with the game's epic scale.\n\nMusic has always been an important element of the Zelda series, increasingly so when Ocarina of Time tied gameplay and sound together over a decade ago. Skyward Sword represents a shift in that dynamic, confining the involvement of music and instruments largely to optional tasks or the plot itself. Don't expect acquiring the harp to significantly change how you'll play the game. Songs are generally discovered and played once as Link continues his adventure. Beyond that, expect to only play strings when Link needs a bit of extra health or wants a hint from a Gossip Stone.\n\nThe standard for music in the Zelda series is very high. While this legacy makes it difficult to rank this score above other titles, some of the themes in Skyward Sword stand alongside Zelda's best, utilizing orchestral music for the first time in the franchise's history. Nintendo was very selective in its usage of the orchestra, opting only for sequences that were very grand in scope. The music that plays as Link flies through the sky is a great example of this.\nNo game is perfect, and Skyward Sword suffers from a few small issues. Every now and then the camera isn't quite in the position it ought to be. The Wii Remote will require calibration here and there, and somehow seems to know when doing so will be most inconvenient. The framerate will dip now and then, and of course the game is constrained by Wii's processing power as well. By and large the biggest amount of grief will come from whether or not the game is meeting some fans' expectations. Key ideas or iconic franchise concepts - you won't see the Iron Knuckle or the infamous Cuccoos here - were thrown out entirely in the name of evolution. All of these are fair observations, but ultimately they pale when compared to Skyward Sword's strengths. In many ways this game represents a breath of fresh air, the next major step for a superb franchise. It's hard to even care about small problems when you're watching Nintendo lay out its vision for the future of its grandest saga.\nVerdict\nThe Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword will be remembered for revitalizing a franchise that had, for a time, seemingly settled for being merely great instead of revolutionary. Once again, Nintendo is demonstrating its unparalleled ability to craft some of the greatest gameplay this industry has ever seen. Remarkably, this Zelda game manages to reshape its control scheme, design sensibility and pacing all at once while still telling a brilliantly powerful story featuring some very memorable characters. Increasingly Nintendo refuses to compromise cinematic storytelling for gameplay, finding a balance that seems effortless.\nIt's fitting that Skyward Sword arrives on Zelda's 25th anniversary, because it truly pulls from the franchise's entire history, even addressing the winding narrative directly within its story. It captures a grandness and scope we haven't seen since the 2D era. It advances combat and control in the most significant way since Ocarina of Time. It finds a tonal and visual harmony between Wind Waker and Twilight Princess. And, most importantly, it leaves a mark on the franchise that future installments will no doubt draw inspiration from for years to come.\nThis is the Wii game we've been waiting for. Through all of the mini-games and odd sports collections, many wondered if and when Nintendo would ever find a way to deliver a deeper experience that still fulfilled on Wii's limitless potential. Skyward Sword makes good on that promise.",

    "title": "God of War: Chains of Olympus",
    "review": "Ready at Dawn Studios burst onto the scene in 2006 with Daxter, a PSP take on the PS2's Jak series, starring everyone's favorite Ottsel. The game was visually stunning for its time, featuring fantastic animation and great overall art design. It also didn't hurt that it was a damn fun title, making it quite the breakout release for the fledgling developer.\n\nGiven Daxter's fantastic showing, I had very high expectations for the studio's second PS2-to-PSP transition, God of War: Chains of Olympus. While creating an offshoot title that stars a sidekick is one thing, it's a whole different ballgame to take the reigns of Kratos and attempt to follow up two of the PlayStation 2's absolute best (and fan favorite) titles. Somehow though, Ready at Dawn has done it again.\n\nChains of Olympus works as a prequel to the original God of War. Kratos has already been saved by Ares and is working out his seemingly never-ending payback by doing the bidding of Olympus. The game opens in Attica, where Kratos helps defend the city against the impeding Persian forces. If you've gotten your hands on the demo disc, you've already played the game's opening moments.\n\n\nAfter chasing down the Persians' basilisk throughout the city, which of course culminates in a signature God of War boss battle, the game shifts its focus to an entirely different tale. I won't even begin to hint at its contents since much of the story is shrouded in mystery until the end, but it does work very nicely into the overall franchise and helps give a little more character to Kratos. There's even a bit of foreshadowing here that relates to what happens in the second and, I assume, third games, which is pretty cool.\n\nAside from its rather stunning visuals, the first thing you'll immediately notice about Chains of Olympus is that Ready at Dawn has done a stellar job of keeping Kratos' move set intact. From what I can tell without doing an actual side-by-side comparison of the two games, Kratos' moves appear to be identical to what you'll find in God of War 2. Furthermore, combat is extremely responsive, perfectly mimicking the console versions. I immediately and naturally went back to my favorite combos, and they worked exactly as I'd remembered.\n\nTHE LIGHTING IS FANTASTIC.\nThough the PSP is missing the L2 and R2 buttons and the right analog stick of the Dual Shock 2, I dare say that the control scheme here works better than on the PS2. Instead of having to use the D-Pad to change between magic types, you now hold R and press a corresponding face button. This means you won't accidentally trigger something you didn't mean to a waste precious magic, and it also means you can switch between them much more easily. Since there isn't a second analog stick, dodging works by pressing L and R at the same time, which again works even better than on the PS2 pad since you don't have to move your thumb off the face buttons. Each of the control changes has been implemented fantastically and you won't miss any of the missing buttons.\n\nGiven that this is a God of War title, most of your time will be spent in combat. Ready at Dawn didn't mess with the franchise's proven formula whatsoever, which is perhaps one of our only (small) gripes for the game. You'll generally lay waste to anything in front of you as you progress through the game's stellar environments, occasionally being trapped in a room until you've dispatched everyone (and everything) inside of it. Like the previous titles, it's a very linear experience, with only small nooks and crannies hidden away with secrets that'll take you off the beaten path for a few moments. It would have been nice to have seen a little experimentation here or there to mix things up. Things like the Pegasus elements of God of War II did this to some extent, but you won't find anything like that here.\n\n\nThe enemies too are largely based on previous beasts that we've seen. If you can imagine lining up the creatures from previous installments and then mixing and matching their abilities a tad, you pretty much know what to expect. That doesn't mean they're boring, as each enemy type has its own unique attack, defense and movement characteristics, meaning that you'll have different combat tactics for everything you face. Still though, it would have been nice to have seen something a little more inventive here, even if it was only one wholly unique creature.\n\nWhile Ready at Dawn didn't stray from the formula, it has done a fantastic job of keeping the intensity the series is known for cranked up to 10 the whole way through. The environments always provide interesting arenas to fight in (or at least look at) and there's never a section where you're not doing something to progress, be it fighting, navigating the environment or solving some sort of puzzle.\n\n\nLike the other God of War titles, the puzzle elements aren't all that difficult by and large, but solving them does generally give you the satisfaction of completing it as the game doesn't hold your hand. It might only take a quick glance around the area to figure out where to move a statue to trigger a door to open, but most things are immediately apparent. Again, most of the puzzles won't test the weight of your brain matter, but they do provide a nice break from the action.\n\nOne other thing that I'm slightly disappointed with is the short list of boss fights. The basilisk that you encounter in Attica is the only gigantic beast you'll fight in the game. You'll find things like Cyclopes and whatnot along the way, but the only boss fight against a huge creature is against the basilisk. That's not to say that the other fights aren't good, but you only once get the satisfaction of taking down something 100 times your size.\n\nTHE COMBAT SYSTEM HAS BEEN PORTED PERFECTLY.\nMagic and an additional weapon are of course present in the game, all of which are new to the title, at least in name. Some of the magic is similar to what we've seen before, like the lightning-esque ranged attack you'll learn, but there are also some cool new unique abilities. I won't go into detail on the other stuff you'll get to keep things as spoiler-free as possible, but it is worth noting that the other weapon you'll get is actually quite useful this time around, especially when upgraded.\n\nWhile Ready at Dawn's first title, Daxter, was a visual accomplishment for its time, God of War: Chains of Olympus is quite simply the best looking title on the system, bar none. Practically everything in the game is on par with what you'll find in the PS2 titles (or close to it, anyway), be it the animation, environments or even the texture work, which is stunning. The care that went into the construction of the environments is phenomenal, especially for a portable game. The sense of scale seen in the console titles remains wholly intact here, with extremely large set pieces that perfectly fit into the God of War universe. The only noticeable downgrade that I wish could have been better is the small number of kill animations for when you grab an enemy, but this is clearly chalked up to memory restrictions and is easily forgiven.\n\n\nPerhaps the most impressive thing about the whole visual presentation is that after you start the game or load a save, you'll never see a loading screen again. Well, if you go backwards to somewhere the game doesn't expect you to then you will, but you can forge straight through the game without looking back and never see a loading icon.\n\nThe audio in Chains of Olympus is right on par with its visuals. The combat effects, which seem like they're ripped right from the PS2 titles, sound great here, and the soundtrack perhaps even better than the score from the first two titles. Phenomenal work here, proving that Ready at Dawn can hit the mark on every level of production.\n\n\nAs has been the case with the original God of War and its sequel, there's a fair bit of bonus content here. The Challenge of Hades replaces the Challenge of the Gods, but works identically, and offers a number of unlockables for use if you can manage to finish it. New costumes for subsequent playthroughs are attainable, there's a small concept gallery and even some \"making of\" stuff. The look inside Ready at Dawn was disappointing as it was just a montage of quick shots from each of the studio's staff, but some of the other stuff is great.\n\nTHE ENVIRONMENTS ARE BREATHTAKING.\nVerdict\nGod of War: Chains of Olympus is a stellar achievement on the PSP. It plays perfectly into the franchise's storyline and offers up the same level of intense action as its console counterparts. It's also the best looking title on the system, without question. Engaging from start to finish, Chains of Olympus is a mandatory purchase for anyone who owns a PSP and doesn't mind getting a little blood on their hands.",

    "title": "The Sims 3",
    "review": "It's been five years since the last Sims title for the Nintendo DS was released, and the title offered more linear gameplay style than its PC counterpart. It was good but not quite the true god-simulator experience people have grown to love and expect from a Sims game. That's changed with The Sims 3 for the DS, as it stays true to the life-simulator formula and also includes Karma powers, a potent way to help or harm your Sims.\n\nBecause DS version is rated \"E\" for Everyone (console and PC versions are \"T\" for Teen), you can't kill Sims. You can torture them if you want, but starvation or fatigue lands them in the hospital instead of the morgue. You also can't \"Woo-Hoo,\" partially because of the rating and because your household can only be a maximum of two people, so there's no room to reproduce. If you can look past those omissions, you'll find the game is largely the same.\n\nYou'll create a Sim (you can only create a household of one) or choose a pre-made family (can be up to two Sims) to start out with and then dictate their lives. The creation tool offers an in-depth way to customize your Sims -- pick their physical appearance, different outfits, voice, favorite things, traits and lifetime wish. Depending on your Sim's characteristics, these goals can range from learning every recipe in the game to becoming the top dog in the criminal career path. Once you have your household of Sims, you'll manage their daily lives making sure their needs of hunger, hygiene, social interaction, fun, bladder and energy are all met.\n\n\nRedesigned to utilize the dual screens of the DS, the majority of your Sim's information (like their Lifetime Wish, Job, Traits, etc.) is sequestered on the top screen. You can tab through the info up there by using the left and right shoulder buttons, and all this frees up the bottom screen for the action. The controls work well and you can move your Sim through everyday life by tapping locations and objects on the screen. The camera is also handled nicely here – you can follow Sims by zooming in, out and around using the face buttons while the D-pad moves the camera around the map. Together, it all works well and the optional tutorial does a fine job of taking you through the motions.\n\nHowever digging into the menus can get a little confusing, especially if you put the game down for a while and then pick it back up. There are obvious symbols for using your phone or traveling into town, but trying to open up the screen where you can buy furniture can be a hassle.\n\nWhile guiding Sims along their lives, their desires will pop up on screen for you to accept or decline. It ranges from small things like buying a book on Logic to mastering a specific skill, and every time you complete a Wish, you'll be rewarded with some Lifetime Happiness points (the amount varies depending on how big the task is). Lifetime Happiness points are important for Karma powers and can also be used to purchase perks like getting complimentary entertainment or being a professional slacker at your job. The rewards are amusing and useful, so they're a great incentive for fulfilling your Sim's Wishes.\n\nOpportunities also play a bigger role in the DS version – they pop up randomly and come in a wide range -- from something simple like cooking hot dogs to going undercover and questioning another Sim. Opportunities have a time limit and reward you with money and/or skill or career boosts, so you'll need to pick and choose carefully so your Sim isn't constantly failing them.\n\n\nThe customization that you'd expect from a Sims game is available but understandably not as robust as the PC or console versions. There's no landscaping, but you can still re-paint your walls, re-tile the floors, and knock down or build walls however you choose. There's a variety of objects for you to buy and make your Sims life richer. The clothing is also more limited (you can't change patterns or colors) but there's still a good selection of pre-rendered threads to choose from, but you can't mix together an outfit that might offend the Fashion Police, like knee-high boots and baggy pants.\n\nKarma powers are included on the DS, but are a bit different than the ones included on consoles. There's a mixture of practical powers like The Muse (increases cooking and painting skills) and playful powers like Winter Wonderland, which changes the season. There are nine total powers, with six good and three bad. Unfortunately, it might take you a while to be able to actually use any of them.\n\nThe biggest alteration to Karma powers for the DS is the way they're unlocked. Gathering enough Lifetime Happiness points (which you get by completing Wishes) automatically uncovers a new Karma power, but then you have to search for a mystery object located in an undisclosed location in order to activate it. This process is a bit annoying, especially because there are \"hints\" that actually don't help you at all and can even lead you astray. It's disappointing that Karma powers are so well-implemented on the console version but the handheld makes them feel like more trouble than they're worth. Still, it's really a bonus more than a full-fledged feature, so you can ignore it entirely or look at it like a treasure hunt.\n\nThough the handheld offers less customization, it makes up for that with an interesting town. There's a graveyard with a haunted house, a lighthouse, a dance club and of course the typical amenities like a gym, library, stadium and movie theater. What's really great is the variety of houses you can move your family into. The town seems fairly populated considering each household can only accommodate two Sims, so it's fun to wander about and meet new folks. It is only one city though, so if you plan on playing multiple games it can get boring once you've already met everyone.\nVerdict\nThe Sims 3 on the DS finally delivers an open-world god-sim experience, but it’s not without some minor frustrations. Karma powers don’t work nearly as well on the handheld as they do on consoles, but if you look at it as a bonus feature rather than an integral piece of the gameplay, it’s not a huge deal. If you’re looking for your Sims fix on the go, the third time is clearly the charm.",
